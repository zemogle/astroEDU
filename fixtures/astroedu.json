"background": "#### Magnetism\n\nMagnets are solid objects which have the ability to attract materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel, along with various other alloys.\n\nAll objects are composed of atoms, which are made up of several different particles, including negatively charged electrons that rotate around the atom nucleus. In magnetic objects the electrons are, at least largely, spinning in the same direction around the nucleus \u2013 this is what causes the object to become magnetic.\n\nIn each magnetic object there are many different groups of atoms, each group forms its own mini-magnet called a *domain*. Magnetic domains that are pointing in opposite directions cancel one another out. The more domains that are aligned (facing the same direction), the stronger the overall magnetic field. In magnets all, or at least most, domains are facing the same direction, combining to create one large magnetic field.\n\nAll magnets have a North and South pole, this is due to the alignment of their domains. Opposite poles attract and the same poles will repel.\n\nMagnets can be natural or induced. Magnets that create their own magnetic fields all the time are called Permanent or hard magnets. Temporary or soft magnets only create a magnetic field for a short time, after being in the presence of another magnetic field.\n\nThe strongest natural magnet is Lodestone. By repeatedly rubbing lodestone along a piece of iron in one direction the iron also becomes magnetised (this is how compasses were created). It is essentially the same process that is used to magnetise the neodymium that is used in this activity.\n\n#### Gravity\n\nGravity is a force that attracts all objects to each other. This is why we don't fall off the Earth even though it is round. It may help to think of 'down' as towards the centre of the Earth. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull. This is why, gravity on the Earth is stronger than on the moon and people feel lighter on the moon (6 times lighter!). This is also why astronauts that are out in space, far from any planets or stars, float.", "fulldesc": "Magnetic levitation, maglev or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields.

If several small magnets are swallowed, they can get stuck in the intestines and cause major swelling, life-threatening injuries and need surgery to remove them. If they place them onto a television screen or computer monitor screen, permanent damage can occur as colours will become permanently distorted.\n\nKeep larger magnets out of children's reach, as you would sharp knives or other dangerous materials, as fingers can be crushed between the powerful magnets.\n\n#### Crushing, blood blisters and cuts\n\nWhen larger magnets are brought close enough together they can have a surprising amount of power. Fingers are quickly caught between them which can cause blood blisters or cuts. Wear gloves when handling larger magnets and use caution. Practice handling smaller magnets first. Do not place these magnets up your nose or around the ears as they have soft tissue that will compress as the magnets attract through the thickness of the tissue and as the magnets get closer as a result, they exert yet more force which crushes still further etc. etc.\n\n#### Magnetically sensitive items\n\nNeodymium magnets are very much stronger than 'ordinary' magnets. Keep a safe distance (200mm+) between the magnets and all objects that can be damaged by magnetism.

Over the last 3.7 billion years or so, life on the Earth has adapted to almost every environment imaginable. But what is it about Earth that makes it so perfectly suited to supporting life?\n\n \n####Distance from the Sun:\nThe Earth lies within our Solar System\u2019s \u2018Habitable Zone\u2019, which is the narrow band within which liquid water can exist. If the Earth were much closer to the Sun, its oceans would vaporize, preventing the existence of life as we know it. If our planet orbited much farther from the Sun, the oceans would freeze and the water cycle that enables life would be non-existent.\n\nThe 'Habitable Zone' is not limited to our own Solar System; it is the area around any star where the temperature is \u2018just right\u2019 for water to exist. These zones are not too cold such that the water freezes, and not too hot such that it boils away. For hotter stars, the habitable zone lies further from the star, and for cooler stars, it is closer.\n\n\n####Water:\nIs water essential for life? On Earth we've yet to discover an organism that doesn't need water to survive. It acts as both a solvent and a delivery mechanism, dissolving essential vitamins and nutrients from food and delivering them to cells. Our bodies also use water to flush out toxins, regulate body temperature and aid our metabolism. No wonder, then, that water makes up nearly 60 percent of our bodies or that we can't go for more than a few days without it.\nWater also promotes life in other ways: we use it to grow crops, keep livestock and wash our food (or our bodies, for that matter). Earth's oceans also help regulate the planet's climate, absorbing heat in the summer and releasing it during the winter. In addition, of course, those same oceans serve as a home for countless plants and animals.\n\nHowever, we simply don't have enough information to say whether or not life could exist without water. We do know with certainty, though, that life on Earth definitely couldn't.\n\n\n####Gravity:\nGravity holds both living and non-living things to the Earth\u2019s surface and keeps them from flying off into space. It also holds our atmosphere in place, stopping it from dissipating into space. Many worlds in the Solar System are smaller than the Earth, meaning they have weaker gravity. Therefore, objects are \u2018lighter\u2019 in these worlds. Other planets are larger than the Earth and have much stronger gravity, which can have a large effect on the environment of these worlds: for example, the pressure at the surface of one of the gas giants is so intense that any life there would be crushed within seconds.\n\n\n####Atmosphere:\nEarth's atmosphere is just the right thickness to sustain life. Without it, we wouldn't be able to breathe. Space is an airless vacuum in which any life form would quickly suffocate. The blanket of our atmosphere also regulates the surface temperature by keeping out the freezing cold of space at night and the furious heat of the Sun during the day. The atmosphere also acts as a protective barrier that absorbs harmful rays from the Sun and other cosmic bodies before they reach the surface.\n\nThe composition of Earth's atmosphere is also very important to life here. Some of the gases act like a greenhouse, keeping heat at the surface. But if these so-called 'greenhouse gases' become too abundant, either naturally or from artificial causes, the planet could warm too much and become uninhabitable for many types of life.\n \nWe have no evidence that extra-terrestrial life would be confined by the same environmental conditions as life on Earth. Other life forms may not need water, oxygen or even a solid surface to thrive; however, like life on Earth, they must have adapted to their environment to survive.", "fulldesc": "The search for extra-terrestrial life is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics in science, particularly to children. With increasing evidence to suggest that the majority of Sun-like stars play host to their own planetary systems, the idea of alien life is seeming ever-more realistic. This activity utilizes the topic of alien life to demonstrate that science can be an exciting, cutting-edge subject and that, like the universe, the opportunities for further discovery in astronomy are almost infinite.\n \nThe following activity deals with both extra-terrestrial worlds and our home planet, Earth. By educating children about the life-essential conditions here on Earth and comparing them to those of other worlds, they learn that this is the only place in the universe that is suitable for life as we know it, which promotes respect for the environment and a sense of a global community.\n \n\n####Advance Preparation:\n- Print off Solar System images (Earth, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Io and Titan).\n- Prepare your computer, projector and script for the \u2018Design an Alien\u2019 presentation.\n- Print off the Martian Alien fact sheet.\n\n### Step 1\n- Split the group into pairs or teams of up to four children.

All objects with mass (weight) have gravity. Gravity acts like a magnet, pulling objects together. What causes gravity is not really known. The Earth has gravity, which holds everything close to the planet so that it does not float into space: trees, water, animals, buildings, and the air we breathe are all held here by gravity. All of the planets, the stars and the moons of the Universe also have gravity. Even our own bodies exert gravitational forces on other objects. The Earth\u2019s gravity is far stronger than our own, so the gravity our bodies possess is not noticeable.\n\nGravity is affected by the size and proximity (closeness) of objects. The Earth and the Moon have a stronger pull on each other than the Earth and Jupiter because the Earth and Moon are closer to one another. Earth has a stronger pull than the Moon because it is larger, so there is more pull on our bodies here on the Earth than the pull on the bodies of astronauts visiting the Moon. That\u2019s why astronauts can jump higher on the moon than on Earth. We don\u2019t actually \u2018feel\u2019 gravity. We only feel the effects of trying to overcome it by jumping, or when we fall. Actually, the man who thought of the \u2018Universal Law of Gravitation\u2018 was inspired by an apple falling on his head as he sat thinking in the garden. The apple was being pulled to Earth by gravity!\n\n####Black Holes\n\nA black hole is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing that enters it can escape, not even light! Black holes form when a massive star runs out of fuel and becomes unable to support its heavy outer layers of gas. If the star is large enough\u2014approximately 25 solar masses\u2014then gravity pulls on the gas and causes the star to grow smaller and smaller until its density reaches infinity at a single point. This is called a \u2018singularity\u2019.\n\nAfter the black hole forms, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings, such as other stars and other black holes. If a black hole absorbs enough material, growing to over one million solar masses, it becomes a \u2018supermassive black hole\u2019. It is believed that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies, including the Milky Way.\n\nA black hole is made up of three parts: the singularity (the collapsed star), the \u2018inner event horizon\u2019 (the region around the singularity where nothing, not even light, can escape), and the \u2018outer event horizon\u2019 (where objects will still feel the gravity of the black hole but do not become trapped).\n\nAstronomers usually observe objects in space by looking at the light. However, since black holes don\u2019t emit any light, they can\u2019t be observed in the usual way. Instead, astronomers have to observe the interaction between the black hole and other objects. For example, as black holes pull material in, like water being sucked down a plughole, the material forms a disc around the black hole. As the disc spins faster and faster, it heats up to extreme temperatures, causing enormous amounts of light and material to be emitted into space as dazzling jets. If they\u2019re pointed towards us, these jets are extremely bright and can easily be picked up by our telescopes on Earth. For black holes that are not \u2018feeding\u2018, one way to detect them is to observe the motions of stars around the black hole, since their orbits will be altered by its presence.\n\n####Space-time\n\nSpace is made up of three dimensions (up-down, left-right and forward-backward). If you add the fourth dimension, time, then you have what\u2019s called the space-time continuum. This might sound strange, but imagine you are meeting somebody; you need to know which location (place in space) to meet them at, but you also need to know which time!\n\nAlbert Einstein was the first person to propose the idea of the \u2018fabric of space\u2019 (space-time), in his \u2018General Theory of Relativity\u2018. Before Einstein\u2019s theories, it was believed that gravity was a force, as explained by Isaac Newton. But Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity explains gravity as the \u2018curvature of space-time\u2019. This concept can be pictured by imagining space-time as a rubber sheet. The balls on the rubber sheet bend the sheet around them, similar to the way matter bends space-time.", "fulldesc": "In the following activity, students will build a model of a black hole, which is intended to help them visualize how exactly a black hole can \u2018bend\u2019 space and time and affect nearby objects. The activity should take about one hour.\n\n###Step 1\nBefore you begin the activity, use the \u2018Background Information\u2019 section to introduce children to the concept of gravity. You can do this by telling the story of Isaac Newton and the apple tree, and having all the children jump up and feel gravity pull them back to Earth.\n\n###Step 2\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image2.jpg)\n\nCut a 40 \u00d7 40 cm piece of elastic bandage. If it is tubular, you will need to cut it through one side to make it flat.\n\n###Step 3\nAsk several students to stretch the bandage horizontally until it becomes taut to represent two-dimensional \u2018space\u2019. Note that the students must hold the bandage still so that their movements do not affect the experiment.\n\n###Step 4\nPlace the marble on the bandage and make it roll across its surface. The marble\u2019s path should follow a straight line, similar to that of a ray of light travelling through space.\n\n###Step 5\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image3.jpg)\n\nSwap the marble for a heavy ball. When you place it on the bandage you will see how it deforms the fabric of \u2018space\u2019. \u2018Space\u2019 becomes curved around the heavy object.\n\n###Step 6\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image4.jpg)\n\nMake the same little marble roll close the heavy object. Its trajectory should now be altered by the deformation of the bandage. This is similar to what happens to light passing close to a massive object that deforms the space surrounding it. Try varying the speed of the marble to see how its path changes.\n\n###Step 7:\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image5.jpg)\n\nThe more concentrated the central mass (i.e., the heavier the large ball), the more curved the bandage will be. This increases the depth of the \u2018gravitational well\u2019 from which the marble will not be able to escape.\n\n###Step 8:\nAs the marble passes close to the large ball, it starts to revolve around the \u2018black hole\u2019 and eventually falls in. You can now see how things may easily fall into a black hole but cannot come back out. This is what happens with black holes: their gravity deforms space in such a way that light or other objects fall in and cannot escape.", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS3 | Physics | - |  Motion and Forces: Forces (gravity)\nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Science | - | Forces and Magnets", "additional_information": "Accessible information about black holes from the \u2018Ask an Astronomer\u2019 site at Cornell University.

The small hole in the thick paper is essential in this regard. If the hole is too big or the paper is too far from the mirror, you will not get a good projection. This will take some experimentation.\n- Make sure the screen does not accidently get moved.\n- Make sure the screen is face on to the mirror so the projected image is circular.\n- The Sun does not take exactly 24 hours to return to the same place in the sky because in that time, the Earth has moved a 1/365th of its journey around the Sun. This phenomenon is masked by the measurement accuracy of this activity, but you might like to discuss it with the students.\n- When performing the calculation we convert 360\u00b0 into 2pi radians. Radians allow us to make calculations involving angles and distances. It can be explained to the students by saying that degrees are a unit. When you walk in a circle, although you have moved 360\u00b0 you have also walked 2pi x radius of the circle. You can prove this by drawing a small circle on paper, wrapping a piece of string around the edge and then measuring the string.

Sunspots are regions of intense magnetic activity where convection is inhibited by strong magnetic fields, reducing energy transport from the hot interior to the surface.

It is a fairly large spiral galaxy and it has three main components: a disk, in which the solar system resides, a central bulge at the core, and an all-encompassing halo. \n\n- The disk of the Milky Way has four spiral arms and it is approximately 300 parsecs thick (1 parsec is approximately 3.26 light years) and 30,000 parsecs in diameter. Compare this to the four hours it takes light to travel from the Sun to Neptune, showing the scale of the Milky Way is immense. It is made up predominantly of Population I stars which tend to be blue and are reasonably young, spanning an age range between a million and ten billion years. \n\n- The bulge, at the centre of the galaxy, is a flattened spheroid of dimension 1000 parsecs by 6000 parsecs. This is a high density region where Population II stars predominate---stars which tend toward red and are very old, about 10 billion years. There is growing evidence for a very massive black hole at its centre. \n\n- The halo, which is a diffuse spherical region, surrounds the disk. It has a low density of old stars mainly in globular clusters (these consist of between 10,000 - 1,000,000 stars). The halo is believed to be composed mainly of dark matter which may extend well beyond the edge of the disk.\n\n####Classification of Galaxies:\nThere are two main categories, the spiral and elliptical galaxies, but also lenticulars and irregulars. \n\n- The spiral category includes our own galaxy. They fall into several classes depending on their shape and the relative size of the bulge: ordinary spirals are labelled either Sa, b, c, d or m while those which have developed a bar in the interior region of the spiral arms are SBa, b, c, d or m. Spiral galaxies are characterized by the presence of gas in the disk which means star formation remains active at the present time, hence the younger population of stars. Spirals are usually found in the low density galactic field where their delicate shape can avoid disruption by tidal forces from neighbouring galaxies. \n\n- The elliptical galaxies are placed in the categories E0-7 depending on their degree of ellipticity, with E0 being least elliptical. They have a uniform luminosity and are similar to the bulge in a spiral galaxy, but with no disk. The stars are old and there is no gas present. Ellipticals are usually found in the high density field, at the centre of clusters. \n\n- Lenticulars are labelled S0 and, although they possess both a bulge and a disk, they have no spiral arms. There is little or no gas and so all the stars are old. They appear to be an intermediate. \n\n- Irregulars are small galaxies, labelled Irr, with no bulge and an ill-defined shape.", "fulldesc": "### Step 1\nDownload the Galaxy image below (attachment 1).\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/68c58abd-1592-42f5-93d6-ef61323cf169/galaxy_442.jpg)\n\n### Step 2\nLay out a glitter sheet or a blue poster board sheet cut to size with white paint starfield.\n\n### Step 3\nMix white paint with a little water and paint a soft white for the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

Its diameter is about 1,400,000 km, which means that more than 100 Earth could be lined up along the Sun's equator, and its mass is more than 300,000 times that of Earth. But compared to other types of stars, the Sun is quite average: the radius (mass) of the smallest type of stars, called \"brown dwarfs\", can be as low as 0.05 solar radius (0.01 solar mass) whereas that of the largest type of stars, called \"supergiants\" or \"hypergiants\", can reach 1000 solar radii (200 solar masses).\nThe Sun produces its energy from thermonuclear reactions taking place at its very centre, where the temperature reaches 15 million degrees. This process, which involves \"burning\" hydrogen and transforming it into helium, has been going on for the last 4.5 billion years and is expected to last about the same amount of time.\n\nThe surface of the Sun, called \"photosphere\", is much cooler than its core, with a temperature of 5500\u00b0C. At certain locations on the photosphere, called \"sunspots\" the temperature is lowered by about 1000\u00b0C due to the action of the magnetic field which \"punctures\" the photosphere at these locations. This makes them appear darker than the surroundings. The spots always appear in pairs with opposite magnetic polarities. (the four irregular shaped areas on the tactile image).\nThe activity of the Sun can be measured by the number of spots appearing on the photosphere during a particular year. This activity varies periodically along a cycle of about 11 years. The last minimum occurred at the end of 2008 and the next maximum is expected in 2013-2014. However, between two consecutive cycles, the magnetic field reverses itself; so a complete cycle is actually 22 years long.\n\nOther remarkable features of the sun are the \"solar prominences\" (loops of thin thread at the edge of the tactile image). They are actual bridges of matter between solar spots, shaped by the powerful magnetic field of the sun. Some of them can be lifted above the photosphere by as much as 350,000 km, which is almost the distance between the Earth and the Moon. They can also be completely disrupted by violent explosions before all the matter has time to fall back onto the surface, in which case some of the matter is sent flowing throughout the solar system.\n\nThe sun has an atmosphere, called the \"chromosphere\" because of its dark orange colour. It can only be seen during natural or artificial eclipses as a thin orange layer around the much brighter photosphere. Finally, above the chromosphere, lies the \"corona\", a region containing very rarefied gas heated up to one million degrees by a process which is still poorly understood. Like the chromosphere, it can only be seen during eclipse as a shiny halo with bright streaks of hot plasma.", "fulldesc": "####Prior to the activity:\n- Print both Sun mold and Sun features PDFs for each group, and prepare the materials listed above.\n- Ask students what they know about the Sun, introducing it as the star closest to Earth and a hot ball of \"burning\" gas.

Huge mountains, craters, highlands and valleys made up the breathtakingly beautiful lunar landscape.\n\nSeveral years after Galilei\u2019s discovery, another Italian astronomer named Giovanni Battista Riccioli created a map on which he named the largest \u2018seas\u2019 of the Moon (see image below). In reality, these seas are dark valleys that look like seas. No liquid water exists on the lunar surface, just some ice in deep craters. Because Riccioli believed that the Moon was directly influencing the weather on Earth, he called some of the seas \u2018Sea of Tranquillity\u2019, \u2018Sea of Serenity\u2019, \u2018Sea of Rain\u2019, \u2018Sea of Clouds\u2019 and \u2018Ocean of Storms\u2019. \n\nThe many craters on the Moon were created a long time ago by meteorite impacts. They all have different sizes and some of them have bright rays around them, an indication of their relatively young age (the dark zones are older). On Earth, the impacts of meteorites disappear over time because of erosion: rain, wind and water smooth the surface by wearing away irregularities until only the most recent ones are still visible. On top of that, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere burns most meteorites before they crash onto the surface. The Moon, however, has no atmosphere, which means that all craters stay intact. This is why the Moon is scarred with so many craters\u2014and they keep increasing in number as time goes by!\n\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/a2090d87-e57a-46b7-85ec-d60f4428a647/1311_lunar_features.jpg)\nCredit moon image: Gregory H.Revera / graphic: C.

What does the crater size depend on? How does the height affect the shape? What does the star-like shape of the throw-offs tell about the direction and velocity of the projectile?

This happens mostly around urban centres, where city lights diminish the view of stars and planets.

The sun has an apparent magnitude of -27, a full moon -13 and the brightest planet Venus measures -5. The brightest man-made objects, Iridium flares are ranked at -9 and the International Space Station -6.", "fulldesc": "####Preparation:\nBefore making the Magnitude Reader in class, overlay the transparency on the printout of the template. Notice that the template printout repeats a pattern of rectangles labelled 1 through 5 three times. Cut the template printout and transparency into thirds, preserving that pattern of rectangles. Make as many templates as there are students.\n\nChoose the constellation you will be viewing as part of the activity, and find a picture of it (as with Orion in this activity). Print out 1 constellation picture per student. (During the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer months in the Southern Hemisphere, Orion is an easily recognizable constellation in the early evening).\n\nBefore students estimate the magnitudes of the stars, you may want to have a star party to teach students how to find the constellation and how to use their magnitude readers to estimate stellar magnitudes in the chosen constellation.\n\n\n####Making the Magnitude Reader: \n\n###Step 1\nHave the students cut out the 5 rectangles (attachment 1) which labelled as 1 through 5 with each transparency still overlaid on top of each template. From this point on, the students do the following. \n\n###Step 2\nUse a coin to trace and cut out 5 circles on the index card or, instead, slightly bend the card lengthwise in half and cut 5 \u2018V\u2019s to create 5 diamond shaped cut-outs. Make sure that the cut-out holes are all slightly spaced in a row across the widest portion of the index card. \n\n###Step 3\nLabel the 5 cut-out holes #1 through 5 from left to right across the index card as shown in the picture below. \nTape transparency piece #1 across hole #1, making sure that the transparency piece covers that hole. In all these steps, when you tape the transparency piece to the index card, the tape should not cover the holes. It does not matter if the rough side of the transparency is face up or down. \n\n###Step 4\nTape transparency piece #2 across holes #1-2, making sure that the transparency piece covers those holes.\n\n###Step 5\nTape transparency piece #3 across the holes #1-3, making sure that the transparency piece covers those holes. \n\n###Step 6\nTape transparency piece #4 across holes #1-4, making sure that the transparency piece covers those holes. \n\n###Step 7\nTape transparency piece #5 across the length of the index card. \n\n###Step 8\nThe 1st hole should have 5 layers of transparency and the 5th hole should have only 1 layer of transparency. \n\n####Estimating the Magnitudes of the Stars:\nDuring winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer months in the Southern Hemisphere, the constellation Orion is visible in the first half of the evening. You can choose to use the drawing of Orion (attachment 1) or that of another constellation that is up in the evening at another time of year. Have the students go out on a moonless, cloudless night in their backyard for a few minutes with the drawing of the constellation and a pencil in hand, and ask them to find the constellation in the night sky. Backyard lights should be off. The students should allow at least 5 minutes outside for their eyes to adapt to the dark. \n\nThe students view each star in the constellation through the Magnitude Reader. For each star in the drawing of the constellation, the students write down the smallest number of the hole through which they can see the star. This is an estimate of the magnitude or brightness of the star. For instance, a star that has a magnitude of 3 will be seen through holes #3, 4 and 5. But the student will record only hole #3. \n\nNote that the students will not be able to see some of the stars on the drawing because of light pollution. Once they have recorded the magnitude for all the stars shown on the drawing of Orion, the highest magnitude (highest number that they record) will be the limiting magnitude (the faintest star) overall that can be seen in the Orion. The students should also record the lighting situation where their data are recorded.\nHave the students bring their results to class. As a class, compare the results. Remember that the lower the magnitudes are, the brighter the stars; the higher the magnitudes are, the dimmer or fainter stars. The students can then estimate how many stars they have lost (e.g., they are unable to see) across their whole sky because of light pollution in their location.\n\n####Extension: Estimating How Many Stars are Lost \n(Based on \u2018Calculating Stars Lost\u2019 by Fred Schaaf in Seeing the Sky, John Wiley & Sons, 1990) \nIn order to complete this activity you will need to determine your local limiting magnitude using your results from the \u2018Estimating the Magnitudes of the Stars\u2019 activity described above.\n \nBy now you know that the number of stars visible is affected by the quality of the night sky. The Moon, atmospheric conditions, and light pollution can make it hard or impossible to see the fainter stars. You have also probably discovered that astronomers use the magnitude scale to measure the brightness of stars. Remember that magnitude 1 stars are brighter than magnitude 2 stars, which are bright than magnitude 3 stars, and so on. \n \nThrough the \u2018Estimating the Magnitudes of Stars\u2019 activity, you have learned to measure the limiting magnitude of your night sky, that is, what are the dimmest stars that can be seen. Under perfect conditions\u2014no Moon, clear skies, and without any interference from any lights\u2014the human eye can see stars down to about 6th or 7th magnitude. According to the table below, a limiting magnitude of 7 is about 14,000 stars!\nNow you are ready to calculate how many stars you are missing at your location. All you have to do is subtract the approximate number of stars visible from your location from 14,000. For example, if you measured your limiting magnitude to be 3, you can see about 150 stars with the naked eye, but you are missing around 13,850 stars (14,000-150 = 13,850)!

When the Moon is full, it is halfway through its monthly orbit of the Earth. This moon often appears a rich yellow when it is full and sits low in the sky. This colour is due to the fact that we look at it through the thicker, dustier part of the atmosphere that is close to the ground.\n\n####Waxing Crescent:\nThe black area is the night on the Moon, where the Sun is not shining. The brighter area is the day on the Moon, where the Sun is reflecting brightly off its surface. The line on the Moon between the night and the day is called \u2018The Terminator\u2019, like the movie of the same name. The bright area, just visible on the edge of the dark limb, is called \u2018earthshine\u2019. The Sun shines on the Earth and that light bounces off of the Earth\u2019s oceans and lights up some of the darkness on the Moon.\n\n####First Quarter:\nThe Moon looks like this when it is one-quarter of the way around the Earth in its monthly orbit. We see a quarter of it lit up from our place on Earth, but half of the Moon is lit up by the Sun shining on the Moon\u2019s surface. In the northern hemisphere the first quarter looks like a growing \"D\", while in the southern hemisphere it looks like a \"C\".\n\n####Last Quarter:\nThe Moon is three-quarters of the way around the Earth when it looks like this. In the northern hemisphere the last quarter looks like a \"C\", while in the southern hemisphere looks like a \"D\".\n\n####Waning Crescent:\nThe Moon has travelled almost all the way around Earth during the month when it looks like this. At this point, it is almost a New Moon. When it is a New Moon, we see no light shining on it at all. The Sun\u2019s light is shining only on the far side of the Moon during a New Moon, so we cannot see the Moon at all from Earth.\n\n####Other Moons of our Solar System:\nSaturn has many moons. Enceladus, one of Saturn\u2019s moons, is one of the most beautiful moons in the Solar System. It has an ocean under its surface that is made of very, very cold water. Every now and then, this water explodes out of the southern half of this moon. The water shoots out of slits in its icy surface, and is shot hundreds of kilometres out into space. Hyperion, another one of Saturn\u2019s moons, is very strange indeed. Most moons go around their planet in a nice, smooth path, but Hyperion tumbles around Saturn. Titan, Saturn\u2019s largest moon, has an atmosphere made of methane and ethane.\n\n####Europa:\nOne of Jupiter\u2019s moons, is an interesting ice moon. It has a smooth icy surface that is covered in lines. The surface is full of fractured ice sections and is very unusual. Under Europa's surface is a cold ocean. Sometime in the future, a spacecraft may land on this moon, drill a hole in the surface and put in a submarine to see if there is anything living within it. Io is another one of Jupiter\u2019s moons. Some people think that it looks a bit like a pizza, but actually, the marks we see are caused by active volcanoes. Io's volcanoes can spray sulphur and sulphur dioxide hundreds of kilometres above its surface. What goes up then falls back down, creating huge circular red, yellow, white and black bruises on its surface. Callisto, another of Jupiter\u2019s moons, is very beautiful. Callisto is one of four of Jupiter\u2019s moons that we can see through a small telescope.It was \ufb01rst discovered by Galileo in 1610.\n\n####Phobos:\nPhobos is the largest and closest of the two natural satellites of Mars. It is so close that it orbits Mars faster than Mars rotates. As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours 15 min or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day. Phobos is named after the Greek god Phobos, a son of Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus) which was the personification of Horror.\n", "fulldesc": "![](/media/activities/attach/6de404f3-9227-4fef-adcb-79fc22d7c063/1404_attachment1.jpg)\n\n####Preparation\nDownload the slideshow of the Moon in the preferred format (jpg, pdf or ppt) from under 'Attachments' in the right hand column.\n\n####Activity\n###Step 1\nOpen the Deadly Moons presentation. Ask students if they have ever seen the Moon in the night sky. How many moons does the Earth have? Do other planets in the solar system have moons?\n\n###Step 2\nSpend just a minute or two on each slide (depending on the group\u2019s age) and relay the related scientific information. Keep explanations brief and encourage the group to be vocal from the start. For each moon, ask students to describe what the moon looks like. E.g. Phobos looks like a potato. For Europa: What do you think it would be like to live in a cold, icy ocean?\n\n###Step 3\nAt the end of the slideshow, ask the students to vote for their favourite moon.\n\n###Step 4\nRepeat the slideshow using a vocal voting system. Ask the kids to give a big \u2018Yay!\u2019 for the moons they like and a \u2018Boo\u2019 for the ones they don\u2019t like.\n\n###Step 5\nTell the students that they will be drawing the most popular moon(s).

This concept turned out to be wrong, but astronomers still use these general categories and labels to describe galaxies.\n\n####The Main Galaxy Types:\n\nElliptical (E), Lenticular (S0), Barred Lenticular (SB0), Spiral (S), Barred Spiral (SB) and Irregular (IR).

It was taken in 2006 using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n####Galaxy Environments:\nGalaxies are found throughout the universe, and live in a variety of environments. Galaxies can be found in clusters, groups, or in isolation.\n\n####Groups:\nSometimes galaxies are found in smaller numbers called groups, with just a handful of galaxies being members of the group. The Local Group contains our Milky Way galaxy, and our next door neighbours the Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda galaxy, along with a few dozen smaller galaxies.\n\n####Field:\nAt other times, galaxies can be isolated and be far from another in the field.  These are called field galaxies.  \n\n####Clusters:\nA galaxy cluster is a large structure in the universe consisting of hundreds or thousands of galaxies that are gravitationally bound together.  The large number of galaxies in a cluster are all packed close together, such as in the Coma Cluster. Clusters make some of the largest, and densest structures in the universe. Clusters, groups, and some isolated galaxies can all be part of even larger structures called superclusters; at the largest scales in the visible universe, superclusters are gathered into filaments and walls surrounding vast voids.

Suggested points of discussion:\n\n- What are significant similarities between schemes?\n- Significant differences?\n- Arguments about how to classify particular galaxies?\n- Why did students decide to design their schemes the way they did?\n- What are other completely different types of schemes you could devise, e.g., if you had different data on the same galaxies?\n- Why is it important (or not) to classify objects we discover?\n- Might classification schemes be changed over time?\n\nThese discussion points can be re-visited later in the activity as well.\n\n(Presumably at least some students will come up with classification schemes based on shape---but if they do not, after discussing their schemes, encourage them to come up with other schemes that are based on shape.)\n\nPrompt students to make observations and ask questions based on their analysis of the image so far, discuss them in groups, and write them down.  The goal is for them to ask, \"Why do different galaxies have different shapes?\"  Then, prompt students to discuss and write down questions and ideas about why galaxies might have different shapes---for example\n\n- Did the galaxies form in different shapes, or did they all form in the same shapes and then evolve into different shapes?\n- What different histories could different galaxies have (especially, that could affect their shapes)?  (encourage students towards the idea of galaxies interacting with each other)\n- Could the evolution of galaxy shape be due to internal processes or driven by external processes?  (e.g., something that happens to all galaxies over time no matter what, or something driven by an interaction with another galaxy)\n- Could the shapes be related to the size of the galaxy when it forms?\n- Are the shapes we observe transient or long-lasting?\n\nWhile students are thinking of these kinds of ideas, encourage students to discuss how they could investigate the answers to these questions.  (Perhaps some students will think of the idea that interactions with other galaxies could be important, and that looking at regions where there are many galaxies so many interactions take place might be a way of investigating this.  Whether they come up with this idea or not, this previous discussion will help them to be in a better position to think through this idea later in the activity.)\n\n###Step 3\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d37a0e75-683c-45c0-b169-00347371cf83/1410_galaxies_table.jpg)\n\nTell students:  Astronomers have developed their own classification scheme for galaxies, based on the galaxy shape (often called \"morphology\").\nThe definitions of the main galaxy types which astronomers use are listed below. Using these definitions, place the 12 galaxies shown in the above figure into their commonly-used categories.  Fill in the table below.\n\n- **Elliptical (E)**: galaxy with a spherical or elliptical shape (like an American football); it has no flat disc or spiral arms.\n\n- **Lenticular (S0)**: galaxy with a smooth, flat disk shape without spiral structure; often hard to distinguish from ellipticals.\n\n- **Barred Lenticular (SB0)**: same as above, but with an elongated (barred) nucleus (galaxy centre).\n\n- **Spiral (S)**: galaxy with a flat disk shape, with notable spiral patterns in the outer disk; also contains a large bright central bulge.\n\n- **Barred Spiral (SB)**: A special type of spiral characterised by an elongated nucleus with the spiral arms springing from the ends of the bar.\n\n- **Irregular (IR)**: an oddly shaped galaxy that doesn't fit into any other category.\n\nMorphology | Image Numbers (3 each)\n:---: | ---\n**E/S0/SB0** | \n**S** | \n**SB** | \n**IR** | \n\nNote: The smallest galaxies are often called dwarf galaxies (No. 5 and No. 7 are dwarf galaxies).  These contain only a few billion stars \u2014 a small number compared to the Milky Way's 200 billion.  The largest ellipticals contain several trillion stars.\n\nDiscuss:  How does the classification scheme used by astronomers compare with the classification schemes designed by members of the class?\n\n###Step 4\nTell students:  Use the image below and guidelines to help decide how to identify and count the galaxies. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d37a0e75-683c-45c0-b169-00347371cf83/1410_coma_galaxy_cluster.jpg)\n\n####Guidelines:\n- **I)** Ellipticals or Lenticulars: it can be hard to tell these apart.  If you know it's either an E or S0 / SB0, it is okay to guess between these two.\n- **II)** Spirals and Barred Spirals: it can be hard to tell these apart.  If you know it's either an S or SB, it is okay to guess between these two.\n- **III)** Irregular galaxy.\n- **IV)** Uncertain: an edge-on view of a galaxy that could possibly be an S0, SB0, S, SB, or IR.  There are too many possibilities, so do not count these.\n- **Star)** any object that has \u2018crosshairs\u2019 sticking out of it is a foreground star in the Milky Way galaxy, so do not count these.\n- **?)** Don't count small, faint objects like these that are too hard to classify.\n\n###Step 5\nDownload the images \u201cGalaxies Cards\u201d A-D to count the types of galaxies seen in each image. Count the number of galaxies of each morphological type and write down the number in the correct spot in the table. \n\nGalaxy Card | E | S0 /SB0 | S | SB | IR/INT\n:---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n**A** | | | | | \n**B** | | | | | \n**C** | | | | | \n**D** | | | | | \n\n###Step 6\nTell students:  Galaxies are found throughout the universe, from our next door neighbours \u2014 the Magellanic Clouds and Andromeda \u2014 all the way out to the visible universe 13 billion light years away. Galaxies live in a variety of environments. Sometimes large numbers of them are packed close together in clusters, such as the Coma Cluster; sometimes they gather in smaller numbers called groups, like the Local Group that contains the Milky Way; and sometimes they are isolated far from one another in the field.  The table below shows the different properties for the different types of galaxy environments.\n\n\nGalaxy Cluster | Large and dense | 50 to thousands | 3 | 2 to 10 Mpc | 10<sup>14</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> solar masses\n:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: \n**Galaxy Group** | **Small and dense** | **less than 50** | **6** | **1 to 2 Mpc** | **10<sup>13</sup> solar masses**\n**The Field** | **Large and deserted** | **very few** | ** 0** | **Voids, can be larger than 100 Mpc** | **< 10<sup>10</sup>**\n\nIn the previous step, Galaxy Cards images A and C show the dense central core of the Coma Cluster, and images B and D show galaxies out in the field. (NB Astronomers sometimes use the term \"field\" to mean the area outside galaxy clusters.)  Fill in the table below using the numbers you wrote down in the table from step 5 of the activity.\n\n####Coma Cluster\n\n\nMorphology\u2192 | E Ellipticals | S0 & SB0 Lenticulars | S & SB (sum both together) Regular and Barred Spirals | Total (E+S0+SB0+S+SB)\n:---: | --- | --- | --- | ---\n**Image A** | | | |\n**Image C** | | | |\n**Sum Total From A + C** | (e) | (f) | (g) | (h)\n\n####The Field\n\nMorphology\u2192 | E Ellipticals | S0 & SB0 Lenticulars | S & SB (sum both together) Regular and Barred Spirals | Total (E+S0+SB0+S+SB)\n:---: | --- | --- | --- | ---\n**Image B** | | | |\n**Image D** | | | |\n**Sum Total From B + D** | (i) | (j) | (k) | (m)\n\n\n###Step 7\nAsk students to think about and discuss in groups:  What trends do you notice from the data you've analysed above?  Do you notice anything about where different types of galaxies tend to be found?  (Extra prompt:  Do you tend to see more spirals in the dense cluster or in the field?  What about ellipticals?) _ Students should notice that spiral galaxies are more common in the field, and ellipticals are more common in dense clusters._  Follow-up question: Does that seem surprising?  The goal here is to get students to ask \"Why does the number of spiral galaxies (or elliptical galaxies) depend on where the galaxy is located?\"\n\nAsk students to discuss and write down ideas for why galaxy type seems to be affected by where the galaxy is located.\nAsk students how they could investigate their ideas: What predictions would their ideas make?  What additional observations or information would they want to have?\nHow could they quantify this trend using the data?\n\n###Step 8\n The following steps tell how students can investigate this trend, first by quantifying it, and then by reading more information about how galaxies form and evolve.  You can tell them exactly what to do as below.---Better yet, have them discuss in groups how they could investigate their question, starting with how to quantify the trend and then determine the procedure _themselves_ for making the calculations below.\n\nUsing a calculator, find the percentages of each galaxy type in the cluster versus the field (Ignore IRs and INTs). Use your numbers from the table above to calculate the percentages and fill in each of these blanks below:\n\n\nIn the Cluster:\n% of Ellipticals (e / h) = __________________ %\n\n% of Lenticulars (f / h) = __________________ %\n\n% of Spirals (g / h) = _____________________ %\n\nIn the Field:\n% of Ellipticals (i / m) = ___________________ %\n\n% of Lenticulars (j / m) = __________________ %\n\n% of Spirals (k / m) = _____________________ %\n\n\nQuestion:\nWhere did you find a higher percentage of spirals - in the Cluster or in the Field? \nAnswer: _________________________________________\n\n\nTell students:\nThe percentages that you just found tell us which types of galaxies are common in the Coma Cluster versus which types are common in the field. Astronomers have done this same experiment on hundreds of thousands of galaxies in the nearby universe, and discovered that the following percentages are pretty typical:\n\n- In dense clusters, 40% of the galaxies are ellipticals, 50% are lenticulars, and 10% are spirals.\n- In the field, 10% of the galaxies are ellipticals, 10% are lenticulars, and 80% are spirals.\n\nWhen galaxies are found very close together there are more ellipticals and lenticulars.  When galaxies are far apart there are more spirals. Astronomers call this the \"morphology-density effect.\"  This term basically means that in crowded galaxy neighbourhoods, like clusters, there are different types of galaxies than are found in open areas, like the field.\n\n\n###Step 9\nStudents should by now (from Step 7) have asked the question, \"Why do we see more elliptical and lenticular galaxies in clusters and more spirals in the field?\"  (This question can also be phrased, \"Why do we observe the morphology-density effect?\")  They should also have had the idea that interactions could be involved, and maybe even the idea that more interactions take place in denser environments, like the center of a cluster.\n\nBelow is information that can be used to answer this question.  You can give students this text to read, then ask them to discuss and write down an explanation for this effect; or you can continue to prompt students to brainstorm and discuss ideas for possible explanations, then potentially have them do research in textbooks / on the internet on their own or in groups, and then have them share their explanations with each other.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMany galaxies contain what astronomers call \"gas,\" which generally means hydrogen gas, sometimes mixed with the gases of other elements, and sometimes mixed also with dust.  Gas clouds can collapse by gravity, which leads to the formation of stars.\nAstronomers have observed many spiral galaxies (S and SB) and find that most of these galaxies contain a lot of gas, and are currently forming lots of new stars. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies (E, S0, and SB0) are gas-poor and are not making many new stars.\n\nGalaxies that are very close to each other, such as those in clusters, often undergo many violent interactions with each other. When a gas-rich spiral galaxy interacts with another galaxy, it tends to quickly use up most of its gas to make new stars, leaving little gas behind. Galaxy-galaxy interactions often change gas-rich galaxies into gas-poor galaxies. Many lenticular galaxies are the remains of old spirals that have lost their gas, and many elliptical galaxies are the remains of several spiral galaxies that have collided.\n\nGalaxy clusters are usually filled with a lot of extremely hot gas that is spread between galaxies throughout the cluster. However, there is no hot gas like this out in the field.  When the radiation from this hot gas hits a spiral galaxy, it strips the spiral galaxy of its much cooler gas in a process called \"ram-pressure stripping.\" This process quickly converts a gas-rich spiral galaxy into a gas-poor lenticular galaxy. Spiral galaxies have a hard time surviving in the superheated gas environment. \n\nAs you see, galaxies change and evolve over time, and galaxies we observe in the nearby universe today have had a very long history already.\n\n\n", "curriculum": "Country | Standard | Lesson\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUSA | Next Generation Science Standards | Content Standard in 9-12 Science as Inquiry (Abilities necessary to do scientific inquiry, Understanding about scientific inquiry)\nUSA | Next Generation Science Standards | Content Standard in 9-12 Earth and Space Science (Origin and evolution of the universe)\n\nCountry | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | GCSE | Physics | AQA Science A | Not in current curriculum   \nUK | GCSE | Physics | Edexcel | P1.3: 2, 7\nUK | GCSE | Physics | OCR A | P7.3.12\nUK | GCSE | Physics | OCR B | P2f\nUK | GCSE | Physics | WJEC | Not in current curriculum\nUK | GCSE | Astrophysics | Edexcel | Unit 1.4: 2a, 2d\nUK | A level | Physics | AQA | Not in current curriculum\nUK | A level | Physics | Edexcel | Not in current curriculum\nUK | A level | Physics | OCR A | 5.5.1a\nUK | A level | Physics | OCR B | Not in current curriculum\nUK | A level | Physics | WJEC | Not in current curriculum\nUK | KS3 | Physics | - | Space Physics: Other Galaxies", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "Students identify the galaxies by making calculations, working through the worksheets and drawing a hypothesis about the morphology-density effect.

Even though the Earth is about 149 million kilometres away from the Sun, we still feel energy from the explosions that happen within it. In fact, all life on Earth depends on the heat and light coming from the Sun.\n\n####Observing Sun\nLooking directly at the Sun, even for a brief moment, is a bad idea \u2014 our eyes are very sensitive to its light. Even in the darkness, at least when there is only the tiniest amount of light, your eyes still manage to detect things. So imagine what happens when you focus all that bright light from the Sun on a tiny area like the eye. The light detectors at the back of the eye get burned. Unfortunately, unlike a sunburn on your skin, your eye probably won't recover.\n\nIf you would like a very visual demonstration of how damaging the Sun can be, have a look at [Stuart Lowe's astronomy blog](http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000347.shtml). He has made a video of what happens when a grape is put up to the eye piece of a telescope which is pointed directly at the Sun, with no filters. Very quickly the grape begins to blacken and burn. An eye is much more delicate than a grape so the demonstration is quite a powerful reminder to be careful when looking at the Sun.\n\n#### So, please, no matter what, do not look directly at the Sun.", "fulldesc": "####Introducing the Sun\nAsk students what in space allows us to see. Should we look at it directly? If it damages our eyes (and cameras) to look at it directly, then how can we look at it. Use filters so most of the light does not reach the eye/camera. Share the background information with students, emphasising not to look at the Sun directly. \n\n####Making the Sun Viewer\n###Step 1\n\nTake a cardboard box and cut a window at one of the short ends. Cut the window as wide as the box and about 3 cm high. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_1.jpg)\n\n###Step 2\n\nCut another window directly above the first. This window needs to be bigger than the previous one, cut it about 5 cm high. The smaller hole is going to be your viewing window. The bigger hole is going to be your projection window.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_2.jpg)\n\n###Step 3\n\nCut a piece of white cardboard to the same size as the bottom of the box.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_3.jpg)\n\n###Step 4\n\nInsert the white cardboard into the opposite end.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_4.jpg)\n\n###Step 5\n\nThis is going to be your projection screen.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_5.jpg)\n\n###Step 6\n\nCut a piece of aluminium foil large enough to completely cover the projection window.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_6.jpg)\n\n###Step 7\n\nHold it up to the light to make sure that there are no holes in the foil.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_7.jpg)\n\n###Step 8\n\nTape the foil over the projection window.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_8.jpg)\n\n###Step 9\n\nHold your box up to an electric light and look through the viewing window to make sure that there are no pinpricks of light sneaking in.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_9.jpg)\n\n###Step 10\n\nSeal any extra holes in the box. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_10.jpg)\n\n###Step 11\n\nTake a pin, nail, or some other small, sharp object, and make a small hole in the foil. (You can experiment with the size of the hole, but about 3 mm works well.)\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_11.jpg)\n\n#### Observing With the Safe Sun Viewer\n###Step 12\n\nRemember not to look at the Sun directly. Go outside and stand with your back to the Sun. Hold the box pointed at the ground so that the Sun\u2019s light can pass through the pinhole in the foil and onto the screen.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_12.jpg)\n\n###Step 13\n\nLook through the bottom window. The small circle of light that you will see is not just \u2018light\u2019 coming through the pinhole, it is an image of the Sun. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_13.jpg)\n\n\n####Warning: Don't look at the Sun directly without proper filtering.\n", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS3 | Physics | - | Space Physics: The Sun \nUK | KS3 | Physics | - | Waves: Light Waves\nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Science | - | Earth and Space\nUK | KS2: Year 3 | Science | - | Light", "additional_information": "Daily Sun images through NASA SOHO website in real time, through different filters:\nhttp://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime/realtime-update.html\n\nSunspots from NASA SOHO:\nhttp://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/sunspots/\n\nVideo about the effects of viewing the Sun through a telescope can have on a grape (which is very similar to an eye):\nhttp://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000347.shtml\n", "conclusion": "This activity teaches the importance of safe solar observation and how to build a cheap but effective pinhole camera from a cardboard box to observe the Sun.

It orbits our planet in 27.3 days at a mean distance of 384,400 km. Its diameter of 3,474 km makes it the fifth largest satellite in the solar system.\n\nIt is thought that the Moon was formed at the same time as the Earth, 4.55 billion years ago, from the debris of a giant collision between the Earth and a Mars-size object.\n\nThe Moon is in on a synchronous orbit around the Earth, which means that it makes one turn around itself as it makes one turn around the Earth. So, it is always showing the same face to us. All we know about the \u2018hidden\u2019 face of the Moon comes from the records taken by astronauts or automatic probes that went around on to the other side. There is no rising or setting of the Earth on the horizon of the Moon. If you were standing on the near side of the Moon, the Earth would appear immobile in the sky.\n\nDuring its revolution around the Earth, the disk of the Moon is not always completely lit by the Sun. This variation in the appearance of the lunar disk is called the \u201cphases of the Moon\u201d, and is characterized by a well-known cycle.\n\nThe apparent diameter of the Moon as seen from Earth is almost exactly that of the Sun. This is why the Moon can sometimes completely mask the solar disk and produce total solar eclipses. Another important influence of the Moon on Earth is the phenomenon of tides, which is due to the Moon\u2019s gravitational pull on the seas and oceans of Earth.\n\nThe Moon is the only celestial object that has been visited by human beings. The first visit was on 21 July 1969 when two members of the Apollo 11 mission set foot on our satellite: they were Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin. As many as 12 astronauts walked the surface of the Moon between 1969 and 1972, and they returned with 382 kg of lunar soil to be analysed on Earth.\n\n###Tactile features:\n(while you explore the tactile schematic image)\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/9b9fd17d-8370-4e4c-9e6f-cbd619dec19a/1408_tactile_moon.jpg)\n\n####Mountains and Maria\nThe visible surface of the Moon shows bright and dark areas. The bright areas are generally hills or mountains (materialized by thick fabric on the tactile image), while the dark ones are flat lands, called \u201cmare\u201d (materialized by thin fabric in relief on the tactile image). These low altitude areas were filled with lava during an ancient period of volcanic activity, around 3 billion years ago. Most of them were named by ancient astronomers after common phenomena encountered on terrestrial seas and oceans: Oceanus Procellarum (\u2018Ocean of Storms\u2019), Mare Imbrium (\u2018Sea of Rains\u2019), Mare Serenitatis (\u2018Sea of Serenity\u2019), Mare Tranquilitatis (\u2018Sea of Tranquility\u2019), etc.\n\n####Craters\nThe whole face of the Moon is dotted with craters, with diameters from a few meters to hundreds of kilometres (curved sequins). They are the result of impacts by asteroids, since the Moon does not have any atmosphere to prevent them from reaching the surface (a few of them are materialized by buttons on the tactile image: Plato and Aristoteles at the top, Aristarchus on the left, Copernicus near the centre, and Clavius at the bottom). Copernicus has a diameter of 93 km and is located in Mare Imbrium at the end of a chain of mountains called Apennins (materialized by the thick fabric on top of the thin fabric on the tactile image).\n\n", "fulldesc": "####Introducing the Moon:\n- Ask students what they know about the Moon. Discuss information included in the first half of the background information section, up to but not including the tactile features. Tell students that they will be making a model of the Moon and investigating its features.\n- Put the students in groups of 5 (ideally 3 non-visually impaired to 2 visually impaired).\n- Distribute materials, including the print outs, to each group.\n\n####Making the Model:\n- Close supervision is important. Follow each group and explain each of the tactile elements and their correspondence to each object feature.\n- Understand the different needs of each group of students to promote interaction between the students during the building of the tactile image. Visually impaired students need to be familiarized with the different materials involved.\n- Allow enough time to follow instructions and build the tactile image.\n\n###Step 1 \nCut the outer round shape of the moon from one of the printed 'Moon Featureless PDF'.\n![](/media/activities/attach/9b9fd17d-8370-4e4c-9e6f-cbd619dec19a/1408_moon_featureless.jpg)\n\n###Step 2\nPlace it on top of the thick fabric and draw a circle.\n\n###Step 3\nCut the same round shape on the thick fabric.\n\n###Step 4\nApply glue on the surface of the moon on the other Moon Featureless PDF.\n\n###Step 5 \nPlace the circular fabric cutout on top of the glued area of the printed paper.\n\n###Step 6 \nUsing the Moon Features PDF, cut out the inner section which has several black dots on.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/9b9fd17d-8370-4e4c-9e6f-cbd619dec19a/1408_moon_features.jpg)\n\n###Step 7\nPlace the inner section on top of the thin fabric and draw the outline of the shape.\n\n###Step 8\nCut out the outlined shape.\n\n###Step 10\nGlue this piece of fabric on top of your fabric moon.\n\n###Step 11\nCut a small piece of the thick fabric and glue it in place so it matches the dashed line on the Moon Features PDF.\n\n###Step 12\nGlue the thick fabric piece on top of the previously glued thin fabric.\n\n###Step 13\nPlace glue on the flat section of the sequins and glue them on top of the fabric, in the same places as the small circles on the Moon Features PDF.\n\nWait for the image to dry before you start exploring.\n\n####Exploring the tactile image:\n\nThere are several ways in which you can explore the scientific content of the tactile schematic images.\n\nIf you\u2019re presenting the final tactile image to the students, first let them explore and feel the different textures. Questions will arise as the students explore; encourage them to write their questions down and share with the other groups. Read \u201cBackground Information\u201d to understand the different features present in Earth\u2019s schematic tactile image, and share with the students as they ask about them, or (if you have more time), prompt each group to choose a feature to learn more about and then have them present to the other groups in the class.\n\n- The Moon\u2019s overall surface is represented by the round shaped thick fabric;\n- The second higher layer of fabric depicts the Maria;\n- Curved sequins depict cratered surfaces;\n- Mountains are depicted by the higher layer of thick fabric.\n\nDiscuss the idea of models with the students.

In magnetic objects the electrons are, at least largely, spinning in the same direction around the nucleus \u2013 this is what causes the object to become magnetic.\n\nIn each magnetic object, there are many different groups of atoms. Each group forms its own mini-magnet called a domain. Magnetic domains that are pointing in opposite directions cancel one another out. The more the domains that are aligned (facing the same direction), the stronger the overall magnetic field. In magnets all, or at least most, domains are facing the same direction, combining to create one large magnetic field.\n\nAll magnets have a north and south pole; this is due to the alignment of their domains. Opposite poles attract and the same poles repel.\n\nMagnets can be natural or induced. Magnets that create their own magnetic fields all the time are called permanent or hard magnets. Temporary or soft magnets only create a magnetic field for a short time, after being in the presence of another magnetic field.\n\nThe strongest natural magnet is Lodestone. By repeatedly rubbing lodestone along a piece of iron in one direction, the iron also becomes magnetised (this is how compasses were created). It is essentially the same process that is used to magnetise the neodymium used in this activity.\n\n####Gravity:\nGravity is a force that attracts all objects to each other. This is why we don't fall off the Earth even though it is round. It may help to think of \u2018down\u2019 as towards the centre of the Earth. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull. This is why gravity on the Earth is stronger than on the moon and people feel lighter on the moon (6 times lighter!). The reason why astronauts in space feel as though they are floating is slightly subtle:  Astronauts do experience gravity when they orbit the Earth or Moon.  However, because they are orbiting the planet, they are constantly falling towards the planet (like falling off a building but never reaching the ground).  Being in free-fall feels like there is no gravity, even though there is.  (It may help to be aware that a common misconception is that astronauts float because they feel no gravity in space.)\n", "fulldesc": "Magnetic levitation, maglev, or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. Magnetic pressure is used to counteract the effects of gravity and any other accelerations.\n\n###Step 1\nFix a cup hook onto one small piece of wood.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e3864a7d-d201-49fd-8a9d-19e793909f46/1407_1.jpg)\n\n###Step 2\nFix a neodymium magnet into the other small piece of wood.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e3864a7d-d201-49fd-8a9d-19e793909f46/1407_2.jpg)\n\n###Step 3\nFix a screw into each corner of the large piece of wood.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e3864a7d-d201-49fd-8a9d-19e793909f46/1407_3.jpg)\n\n###Step 4\nAttach both small pieces of wood to the larger piece using the inserted screws to make a frame.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e3864a7d-d201-49fd-8a9d-19e793909f46/1407_4.jpg)\n\n###Step 5\nTie the piece of thread to the paper clip.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e3864a7d-d201-49fd-8a9d-19e793909f46/1407_5.jpg)\n\n###Step 6\nGlue the paper clip (now with thread attached) to the back of an astronaut image, then glue on the other astronaut image so the paper clip is hidden between the two.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e3864a7d-d201-49fd-8a9d-19e793909f46/1407_6.jpg)\n\n###Step 7\nAttach the thread to the cup hook and adjust so that the astronaut does not reach the opposite end of the frame. (Cut away any extra thread.)\n\n###Step 8\nAsk students to predict what will happen when you release the astronaut, and why they think so.  (Will it fall or float or something else?)  Make sure students specifically discuss the idea of gravity as the reason the astronaut might fall, and be sure to ask students what gravity is.\n\n###Step 9\nThen release the astronaut and watch it levitate!\n\n###Beyond building your levitating astronaut:\nNow that you have built your astronaut, prompt students to observe it carefully, ask questions about the phenomenon they are observing, and experiment with the apparatus.  For example, they could ask why the astronaut levitates, or what would happen if they change the orientation of the astronaut, or if they used different materials.  You can break students into small groups to investigate these questions together, and share with them information about magnetism and gravity from the \"Background Information\" section.\n\nYou can also prompt students to discuss the idea of building models.  Suggested discussion points:\n\n- What is a model?  Why is it useful to build models?\n- What is the goal of this model of an astronaut?\n- What are the strengths of this model?

If several small magnets are swallowed, they can get stuck in the intestines and cause major swelling, life-threatening injuries, and surgery would be needed to remove them. If placed onto a television screen or computer monitor screen, it could permanently distort the colours on the screen.\nKeep larger magnets out of children's reach, as you would with sharp knives or other dangerous materials, as fingers can be crushed between powerful magnets.\n\n####Crushing, blood blisters, and cuts:\nWhen larger magnets are brought close enough together they can have a surprising amount of power. Fingers are quickly caught between them which can cause blood blisters or cuts. Wear gloves when handling larger magnets and use caution. Practice handling smaller magnets first. Do not place these magnets up your nose or around the ears as they have soft tissue that will compress as the magnets attract each other through the tissue. As the magnets get closer, they exert more force that crushes the tissue still further.\n\n####Magnetically sensitive items:\nNeodymium magnets are stronger than 'ordinary' magnets. Keep a safe distance (200mm+) between the magnets and all objects that can be damaged by magnetism.

This distance is such that the average surface temperature is above the freezing point of water (0\u00b0C) and liquid water can exist freely. This has played a fundamental role in the development of life on our planet, unlike on Venus and Mars, whose surface temperatures are either much warmer or much colder.\nThe shape of the Earth is very close to a sphere. Because of its slow rotation \u2014 once every 24 h \u2014 the distortions are small, the difference between the equatorial radius (6,378 km) and the polar radius (6,357 km) being only 21 km. Earth only has one natural satellite, the Moon, which is thought to have played a major role in stabilising the axis of rotation of the Earth. Once again, this may have been a favourable element in the emergence of life.\n\n####Tactile features\n(while you explore the tactile schematic image)\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/9271e124-6a1a-4bed-a650-ad104b9972e6/1406_tactile_earth.jpg)\n\n####Liquid water, continents and polar caps\nOn Earth, 71% of the surface is covered by liquid water (represented by plastic on the tactile image), so the area occupied by seas and oceans is more than twice that occupied by land. The distribution of lands and seas is unequal and peculiar: majority of land masses are in located in the Northern hemisphere as three major continents: Europe, Asia, and North America (continents are represented by the thick fabric on the tactile image). The poles of the Earth are also quite different: there is an ice-covered continent at the South Pole (Antarctica), but an ocean at the North Pole (the Arctic Ocean), which forms an ice cap in winter (both represented by the aluminium foil on the tactile image).\nOn Earth, surface elevations are measured with respect to the mean sea level. They vary between a height of 8,848 m (Mount Everest) and a depth of 11,000 m (the Mariana Trench in the northwest part of the Pacific Ocean). The average depth of the oceans is 3,800 m, and the average altitude of land is 840 m.\n\n####Clouds and hurricanes\nEarth has a relatively thin atmosphere extending to less than 200 km altitude. Dry air is mainly composed of nitrogen (N2: 78.08%), oxygen (O2: 20.95%), and argon (Ar: 0.93%). The remaining 0.04% is a mixture of \u201ctrace\u201d gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO2), but also rare gases such as neon (Ne), helium (He), and krypton (Kr). On average, water vapour (H2O) accounts for 0.25% of the mass of the atmosphere, but its concentration varies a lot depending on the local temperature: it can be anywhere between 0.01% and 5%. When lifted to the upper parts of the atmosphere (above 3000 m on average), water vapour condenses to form clouds of very diverse densities and shapes (represented by clumps of cotton on the tactile image); some of these clouds can develop into powerful hurricanes over the oceans (represented by curled wire and cotton on the tactile image).\nEarth\u2019s climate has recently begun undergoing an unprecedentedly fast warming phase due to the action of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d, such as carbon dioxide and methane, that humans have been releasing in large quantities since the beginning of the industrial era. These gases tend to trap infrared radiation from the Earth's surface, causing the Earth's surface to heat up; we call this phenomenon the \"greenhouse effect.\"", "fulldesc": "####Prior to the activity:\n- Print both Earth mold and Earth features PDFs for each group, and prepare the materials listed above.\n- Ask students what they know about the Earth, and how it looks from space.

Visible light composes a significantly small portion of the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, or light, where roughly 400nm coincides with the colour violet (shorter wavelength) and 700nm coincides with the colour red (longer wavelength). Light is believed to travel faster than anything else in the universe at 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometres per second). However, this still has implications that limit the ability of anything to travel instantaneously. For example, although it seems that light from the Sun reaches us instantaneously, if the Sun were to suddenly go dark it would take about 8 minutes for anyone on Earth to realize this fact since there are about 93 million miles (149 million kilometres) between the Sun and the Earth. \n\nThese facts about light have effect on the transfer of information through technology as well as the study of astronomy. First of all, because light can travel the fastest of anything in the universe, this makes it a perfect medium to transfer information seemingly instantaneously. Optical fibres are new technology meant to take advantage of the speed of light to transfer information at these speeds. These fibres are flexible, extremely thin, transparent, and made with high quality extruded glass or plastic. This makes them a perfect option for transferring information through a variety of situations that may include turning corners or curves and protecting the information being transferred from outside impacts (that may block the information from reaching its destination). A common use for this technology recently is the internet. Through its use, internet speeds have been significantly increased and are more reliable. Additionally, this technology has been used to create the Fibre-Optic Link around the Globe which uses fibre optic cables laid out (mostly) along the ocean floor to connect the eastern coast of North American all the way to Japan.\n\nThis technology has also had many impacts on the study of astronomy. Some research tools in astronomy that use fibre optics include multi-object spectroscopy, bi-dimensional spectroscopy, high-precision radial-velocity spectroscopy, interferometry, and photometry. A deeper discussion of these uses may be found in the paper \u201cThe Astronomical Uses of Optical Fibers\u201d appearing in the ASP Conference Series, Vol. 152 by Ian R. Parry. The Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS) is used in astronomy to collect light from many stars or galaxies at the same time allowing a wide range of information from a variety of targets to be viewed and collected simultaneously allowing for studies on galaxy formation and evolution as well as other studies. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is one such example of how this technology is used to accomplish great things. Precise holes are drilled through a plate to go on the telescope so that the holes coincide with the many objects that will be observed at the same time. A fibre optic cable is inserted into each hole so that the light from each object, only, will be collected by that fibre optic cable and fed into a spectrograph which can then analyze the light from that object to learn more about it. In this way, thousands of objects in the universe are observed and precisely studied for their properties simultaneously. Beginning in 2000 the SDSS has had several phases during which more than a third of the night sky has been surveyed and spectra on over 5 million stars and galaxies has been collected. SDSS data is publicly available and is also used for educational programs as well such as Zooniverse\u2019s Galaxy Zoo which invites anyone that wants to be a \u201cCitizen Scientist\u201d to investigate SDSS data to identify galaxies observed by SDSS.", "fulldesc": "###Getting Ready\n\nBefore the activity starts, have the teacher prepare a note or a fun little item to hide in the compartment in the ball. The students will stand for the demo and randomly arrange themselves about the room. After tossing the ball a path will be marked with a cord, mirrors will be passed out, and a laser pointer will be given to the starting student while the last student has a target. \n\n###Activity 1: Demo Walkthrough - Light and Fibre Optics\n\n**1.** Begin with an explanation of the dangers of lasers and a safety requirement that all students be sure to use the laser responsibly. If laser safety glasses are available have students wear them, if not, perhaps limit the number of students using the laser and mirrors to fewer students to avoid any possible risk of the laser shining in anyone\u2019s eyes.\n\n**2.** Start with everyone standing around the room randomly. Next, have the \u2018start\u2019 student yell something across the room to the \u2018end\u2019 student. Ask the students what they would have to do to get their message from the start to the end if they could not yell to the other person across the room.\n\n**3.** Next have the \u2018start\u2019 student whisper their statement to the person closest to them, proceed to have each student whisper what was said throughout the room, going through every student, until it ends with the final student. Have the final student announce what was said by the original student. This is a good time to talk about the problems of different options of communicating and how sometimes the message may get \u2018garbled.\u2019\n\n**4.** Now give the ball with the note inside it to the first student and tell the students to begin tossing the ball through the room so that each person will catch it and pass it until it gets to the final student. Mark the path that the ball takes with the length of clear plastic cord. The final student will remove the note in the ball and announce what it says. Ask the students if there\u2019s anything that might be able to take the same path that the ball took and get the information to the end.\n\n**5.** Hand out mirrors to everyone in the middle, a laser pointer to the starting person, and a target to the last person. \n\n**6.** Tell the students that now they have to recreate the path the ball took, but with the laser pointer using mirrors to reflect the light to the target (WARNING: Do not shine lasers into eyes. Completely brief the students on the use of the laser before the activity begins, remind them once again at this point, and if possible include safety glasses.) This is a good opportunity to discuss photons in more detail.\n\n**7.** Now challenge the students to get the laser from the first student to the last student in the same path that the ball took (use the cord on the floor to remember). Students will almost immediately realize that using this many mirrors to bounce the laser light will not work, end this part of the activity.\n\n**8.** Now challenge the first student and two students between the last student to do the same, but only by bouncing the light off of their two mirrors to hit the target, this should be much easier. \n\n**9.** (If the Laser Radio Communicator is being used) Switch out the regular laser with the laser radio laser and the target with the photoreceptor. Now have the students do the same so that by hitting the \u2018target\u2019 (the photoreceptor) they\u2019re hearing the radio. \n\n**10.** Explain to the students how light can be used to transfer information. If the laser radio is being used you can explain that the brightness of the laser is changing so that the information about the sound of the music is what we hear. This can also be tied to the way that the patterns of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s is used to transfer information like morse code and how the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s could be the laser being bright or dark. Show the students that whenever the path of the light is blocked the radio stops showing that it\u2019s also an imperfect form of communication to lead into the next questions.\n\n**11.** Ask the students if there\u2019s any other way we could get the laser light from one end to the other but with everyone. Encourage the students to think about the ideal situation, for example, if everyone could hold perfectly still but explain how this is not really a plausible situation. Encourage them to think about other ways it could be done until they begin to imagine surrounding the laser beam with a tube of mirrors. Ask if there is anything like this that they know of.\n\n**12.** Tell the students to remember how they bounced the light, then ask them to pick up the cord on the floor and have the final student point the end of the cord at the target.\n\n**13.** The first student should now take the laser s/he holds and touch it to the end of the cord while turning on the laser. The light should shine through the cord, reflect internally, and come out of the other end to hit the target. Ask the students what just happened. They should make the connection that the laser light is bouncing inside of the cord and moving through it until it gets to the end, just like their proposed solution of many mirrors surrounding the laser light.\n\n**14.** Explain Total Internal Reflection. Some drawings on the board of the light internally reflecting throughout the cord may be useful.\n\n**15.** If using the laser radio, ask the students if this method would work with the laser radio. Have the students switch the starting point and ending point once more with the laser radio, but this time shine the laser through the cord to hit the photoreceptor. Ask if there\u2019s some way to \u2018block\u2019 the signal now.\n\n**16.** Ask if they know of something like this that is used today. After some responses bring out the fibre optic lamp and show them that this is exactly what\u2019s happening but on a smaller scale with these fibre optics transferring the light in the lamp. \n\n**17.** This is a good point to show the video explanation from YouTube \u201cFibre Optic Cables: How they Work.\u201d\n\n**18.** Now that the concept used in fibre optics is understood you can move on to explain how it is applied in the real world. The internet is one real world example that may be used. The following activity explains how fibre optics are used in astronomy.\n\n###Activity 2: Make a model of a Multi-object Spectrograph\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dd40edd4-d03e-4e85-af75-23a096edf6b0/1411-Galaxy-Fields.jpg)\n\n**1.** Start by having the students watch the video about the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to learn about how fibre optics are used in combination with telescopes to take observations of many objects all at once.\n\n**2.** Hand out to all students print-outs of \u2018galaxy fields\u2019 and scissors. The attached word document can be used and edited to make different types of fields that include stars and galaxies. Have the students use the paper to cut out matching holes in the paper plate (similar to how scientists manufacture the plates used in the SDSS shown in the video that collect light of individual stars as they correspond to the plates with fibre optics attached). This will help them understand the difficulty of precisely matching a star-field with the manufacturing of the SDSS plates for fibre optics.\n\n**3.** After the students have cut out all of the \u2018galaxies\u2019 and \u2018stars\u2019 on their galaxy field they should observe the pattern of holes and see how the light shines through just like with the plates used by SDSS. Also discuss the difficulty of making precise holes for each star or galaxy and how much more precision and accuracy it must take for SDSS to accomplish this for hundreds of galaxies and stars on each plate that they make.\n\n**4.** Next, pass out lengths of string and tape or pipe cleaners, tell the students to use the string/pipe cleaners like the fibre optics are used by SDSS to \u2018plug in\u2019 to the holes so that the light coming through the holes will be collected by the individual fibre optics for observation. \n\n**5.** Ask the students to discuss the role of the plate and string/pipe cleaners in research. In other words, see if they can describe the process of the starlight entering the telescope, moving through the plate into the fibre optics into the spectrograph, and then the light being analyzed by the spectrograph to give the scientists information.\n\n**6.** End by watching the YouTube video \u201cTools of Astronomy\u201d and discuss the many ways that we have for observing the universe and how there are many different techniques for using technology to accomplish different goals. For example, this is a good lead in to further explain spectroscopy and how light may be used to identify the compositions of stars and galaxies. \n\n###Activity 3: Galaxy Zoo\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dd40edd4-d03e-4e85-af75-23a096edf6b0/1411-galaxy-zoo.jpg)\n\n**1.** An additional follow-up activity for students if computers are available is to introduce them to the Galaxy Zoo project. It should be noted to the students that Galaxy Zoo is not the result of observations from SDSS using the Multi-object spectrograph but just another example of how useful surveys such as this are to study the universe in a variety of ways as well as how light can tell us many different things about an object being observed.\n\n**2.** Have students work in groups (depending on how many computers are available) to go through the Galaxy Zoo tutorial and project to learn about how SDSS data is publicly available and has been developed into a citizen science project for classifying galaxies.\n\n**3.** Encourage students to continue participating in citizen science and galaxy zoo at home, and remember all the hard work that goes into developing the technology to collect this information as well as the hard work that goes into the actual collection of this information.\n\n", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS3 | Physics | - | Waves: Light waves\nUK | KS2: Year 6 | Science | - | Light\n\n**USA**\n\nThis activity either discusses or relates to topics included in the new Next Generation Science Standards in the USA. Additional materials may be added by the teacher to further tie these activities to a variety of the following topics.\nMore information on these may be found at\n \n- http://www.nextgenscience.org/msps-wer-waves-electromagnetic-radiation\n- http://www.nextgenscience.org/hsps-wer-waves-electromagnetic-radiation\n- http://www.nextgenscience.org/hsess-ss-space-systems\n\n**Middle School:**\n\nPS4.A: Wave Properties\n\n- A simple wave has a repeating pattern with a specific wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. (MS-PS4-1)\n\nPS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation\n\n- When light shines on an object, it is reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through the object, depending on the object\u2019s material and the frequency (color) of the light. (MS-PS4-2)\n- The path that light travels can be traced as straight lines, except at surfaces between different transparent materials (e.g., air and water, air and glass) where the light path bends. (MS-PS4-2)\n- A wave model of light is useful for explaining brightness, color, and the frequency-dependent bending of light at a surface between media. (MS-PS4-2)\n- However, because light can travel through space, it cannot be a matter wave, like sound or water waves. (MS-PS4-2)\n\nPS4.C: Information Technologies and Instrumentation\n\n- Digitized signals (sent as wave pulses) are a more reliable way to encode and transmit information. (MS-PS4-3)\n\n**High School:**\n\nPS4.A: Wave Properties\n\n- The wavelength and frequency of a wave are related to one another by the speed of travel of the wave, which depends on the type of wave and the medium through which it is passing. (HS-PS4-1)\n- Information can be digitized (e.g., a picture stored as the values of an array of pixels); in this form, it can be stored reliably in computer memory and sent over long distances as a series of wave pulses. (HS-PS4-2),(HS-PS4-5)\n- [From the 3\u20135 grade band endpoints] Waves can add or cancel one another as they cross, depending on their relative phase (i.e., relative position of peaks and troughs of the waves), but they emerge unaffected by each other. (Boundary: The discussion at this grade level is qualitative only; it can be based on the fact that two different sounds can pass a location in different directions without getting mixed up.) (HS-PS4-3)\n\nPS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation\n\n- Electromagnetic radiation (e.g., radio, microwaves, light) can be modeled as a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields or as particles called photons. The wave model is useful for explaining many features of electromagnetic radiation, and the particle model explains other features. (HS-PS4-3)\n\nPS4.C: Information Technologies and Instrumentation\n\n- Multiple technologies based on the understanding of waves and their interactions with matter are part of everyday experiences in the modern world (e.g., medical imaging, communications, scanners) and in scientific research. They are essential tools for producing, transmitting, and capturing signals and for storing and interpreting the information contained in them. (HS-PS4-5)\n\nESS1.A: The Universe and Its Stars\n\n- The study of stars\u2019 light spectra and brightness is used to identify compositional elements of stars, their movements, and their distances from Earth. (HS-ESS1-2),(HS-ESS1-3)\n\nPS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation\n\n- Atoms of each element emit and absorb characteristic frequencies of light. These characteristics allow identification of the presence of an element, even in microscopic quantities.(secondary to HS-ESS1-2)\n", "additional_information": "- [The Astronomical Uses of Optical Fibers by Ian R.

Distances in the Solar System are very large compared to the sizes of the planets. More than 10,000 Earths fit in the distance Earth-Sun. (The Earth\u2019s diameter fits more than 100 times in the Sun\u2019s, and more than 100 Suns fit in the distance Earth-Sun.) Astronomers call this distance an astronomical unit. In the distance to our neighbouring planets Venus and Mars fit respectively 3,300 and 6,100 Earths. And that is when the planets are closest to each other in their orbits. Usually our neighbours are much farther. Even to by far the closest celestial object, our Moon, you have to travel a distance of 30 Earths in a row. These large distances result in very small images of Earth when you look back from other planets.\n\nThe Earth is a finite sphere with finite resources that can be depleted by mankind. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is very thin compared to its diameter. If the Earth were an apple, than the atmosphere is thinner an apple\u2019s skin. Humans can easily alter the composition of this thin atmosphere. If too much greenhouse gasses are put into the atmosphere, the Earth will warm because of a stronger greenhouse effect. This has dramatic consequences for our civilization, such as rising sea level, wider deserts, altering climates, and a runaway warming effect to increase the global temperature even more. With no known alien life to help us, or closeby habitable planets, we depent on the Earth.\n\n**Global citizenship**\n\nOne of the primary goals of the educational project Universe Awareness (UNAWE) is to give children a sense of global citizenship. We all live on the same tiny blue planet floating around in the vast emptiness of space. When you are dealing with the extreme dimensions of planets, stars and the Universe in general, your perspective shifts from the local community you live in to the global community. Everyone on this planet sees the same Moon and the same Sun in the same sky. Dealing with astronomy is an identical experience for any human being. The realisation that we all share this one little sphere as our home bonds us as a species and makes us think about how we can work together to cherish the only safe haven in space that we have.\n\nThis [video](http://goo.gl/t8l0R) exactly embodies the message Universe Awareness wants to promote. When astronauts went into space for the first time in the early 1960s and looked back upon Earth, they saw something that no human had ever seen before: the Earth floating around in empty space, a bright blue ball standing out against the dark, infinite background. These astronauts experienced the ultimate sense of global citizenship, termed the \u2018overview effect\u2019. They were able to communicate UNAWE\u2019s message like no-one else could, using a video of the Earth from space.\n\n**International Space Station**\n\nWith advances in camera technology, astronauts nowadays are able to make extremely high quality movies of the Earth viewed from the International Space Station (ISS) as they orbit the planet every 90 minutes. This [footage](http://goo.gl/uF2nd) shows our planet in amazing detail and depicts a thriving world without any borders.\n\n**Cosmology**\n\nAs a species, we do not only share one home planet, but also one history. Of course, every culture has its own background, but humanity as a whole has one, too\u2014that is, a \u2018cosmic history\u2019. Cosmology tells the story of the Universe from its very beginning to the moment stars and planets formed. This story tells us that humans\u2014despite their skin colour or culture\u2014are all made of the same stuff: stardust. In fact, think of any person in the world, odds are that you carry some atoms in your body that were once in theirs!", "fulldesc": "###Step 1:\nShow the students the video filmed from the ISS as it orbits the Earth every 90 minutes, looking down on the planet\u2019s surface from a height of 370 km.\n\n###Step 2: \nAsk the students if they recognise Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Emphasise how thin and vulnerable this actually is, in comparison to the size of the Earth. If the Earth were an apple, the atmosphere would be thinner than its skin. Ask them what else they see.\n\n###Step 3:\n![](/media/activities/attach/5dc14ec3-0b62-41ae-93f4-e43c064108c7/1412-earth-from-space.jpg)\nThe students have now had a first overview of Earth, although they didn\u2019t see it as just a sphere floating in space (for this, show them 'Earth from Space' image) Explain how the border between day and night shifts from east to west (right to left) across the surface of the Earth. The Earth rotates around its axis in the eastern direction\u2014counter clockwise, if you look from space down on the North Pole\u2014with the Sun as a fixed background light. If you look from space down on the South Pole, the Earth rotates clockwise (still in eastern direction).\n\n###Step 4:\n![](/media/activities/attach/5dc14ec3-0b62-41ae-93f4-e43c064108c7/1412-earth-rise.jpg)\nNow, we travel even further outwards, to the Moon. Show the students 'Earthrise' image (a photograph taken by the astronauts from the Apollo 8 mission in 1968.) These astronauts were the first people to ever orbit a celestial body other than the Earth, and when they looked back at their home planet, they experienced the so-called overview effect: everything they had ever known and loved was on that tiny blue marble, hanging peacefully in space.\n\n###Step 5:\nAt this point, you can make the shift from photos to model objects. Take the earth ball and hand a Styrofoam sphere (10 cm in diameter) to one volunteer. If you don\u2019t have a ball of that exact size, then use a sphere that approximately fits on Australia on the earth ball, for example an orange. If you use a globe instead of the earth ball, adjust the sizes of the objects accordingly. For example, of you use a globe that is 20 cm in diameter, use a 5 cm moon and also divide the next sizes and distances in this activity in half.\n\n###Step 6:\nAsk the volunteer to hold this model of the Moon at a distance from the earth ball that he/she thinks is correct, according to this scale. \n\n###Step 7:\nAsk the other students if they agree, and if not, let them stand at a distance they think is right. The correct answer is a distance of 30 earth balls (or whatever globe you use) in a row. For the earth ball this is 12 meters, meaning all the way to the back of the classroom, or even outside. Let the students look at the earth ball from there and tell them that this is the size of the Earth as it would appear if they were to stand on the Moon.\n\n###Step 8:\nWe proceed on our virtual journey, now, to the other planets. Ask the students to remain at the back of the classroom. Now hold up a sphere of about 0.25 cm in diameter, for example a peppercorn or popcorn seed. The students will be looking at the Earth as viewed from Mars at its closest distance to Earth! \n\n###Step 9:\n![](/media/activities/attach/5dc14ec3-0b62-41ae-93f4-e43c064108c7/1412-Pale-Blue-Dot.jpg)\nShow the students 'Pale Blue Dot' image, which is a photograph taken by Voyager 1, a spacecraft that was sent out into space in 1977 and has now long since passed the orbit of Neptune\u2014the outermost planet of our Solar System. Of course, Voyager 1 is unmanned. In fact, no human has ever travelled farther than the Moon. In the picture, you can see a teeny tiny \u2018blue pale dot\u2019. This is how small the Earth looks from 6 billion kilometres away, which is about the average distance to Pluto. Almost half a million Earths in a row fit in this distance. It takes an airplane more than 600 years to fly there! The stripes in the picture are just \u2018noise\u2019.\n\n###Step 10:\nAsk the students if their perspective of Earth has changed. Do they think the Earth is big enough to provide is with inexhaustible resources? Explain that the Earth is a sphere with a finite atmosphere and finite resources. If we polute our planet, there is no-one in space that can help us. We have nowhere to go. The Earth is the only home we have.\n\n**Note:** For students aged 9\u201310 years, you can extend this activity by getting into the subject of searching for life on exoplanets, which are planets outside our Solar System. So far, close to two thousand exoplanets have been discovered. For the current count, check out &lt;http: planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov=\"\">. From this activity, the students have learned that the Earth looks very small from outside the Solar System. This demonstrates that from Earth\u2019s perspective, exoplanets must seem very small indeed and are very difficult to see. Therefore, it\u2019s hard to determine whether life has developed on them. Even with very strong telescopes, astronomers can rarely see the planet, never mind zoom in far enough to look for living organisms!\n\nHowever, methods are available to examine exoplanets. \n\nAsk the students to think of ways to find out if a planet is hospitable to life, or even to check for actual life. The most important requirement for life is the presence of liquid water. The planet should be far enough from its host star so that water, if present, won\u2019t evaporate. But it shouldn\u2019t be too far, otherwise the water would freeze. Also, an atmosphere is probably necessary to protect life from harmful radiation and large temperature variations. In the future, astronomers might have developed such high-quality telescopes that they can see an exoplanet\u2019s colour, from which they could deduce whether it has vegetation.\n\nSo far, however, we haven\u2019t found a planet that is just like Earth. If we do, it will probably be very far away, meaning it will be difficult to study with our telescopes. Emphasise that lots of work still needs to be done in this area: if the students grow up to be astronomers, they might make a breakthrough discovery\u2014they might even find life!", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Science | - | Earth and Space\nNL | Kerndoelen | - | - | 28, 33, 38, 39, 46", "additional_information": "- The shift in awareness about the world the astronauts experience is also known as the overview effect: http://goo.gl/OuH9v\n- Frank White's blog on The Overview Institute (author of \"The Overview Effect: Space Exploration and Human Evolution\"): http://www.overviewinstitute.org/blog/bloggers/frank-white\n- \"Overview\" video by the Planetary Collective which documents astronauts\u2019 life-changing stories of seeing the Earth from the outside \u2013 a perspective-altering experience often described as the Overview Effect: http://goo.gl/t8l0R\n- \"Further Up Yonder: A Message from ISS to All Humankind\", a video by Italian videomaker, Giacomo Sardelli, about the International Space Station, its inhabitants, and its role in space exploration: http://goo.gl/uF2nd\n- Frank White wrote a book about this topic: The Overview Effect\n- Read more about the cosmic perspective we gain from cosmology: http://goo.gl/Fg62S", "conclusion": "The activity should help students learn about scale and distance of the solar system and how important yet small the Earth is.

The Moon reflects the light of the Sun; it does not make its own light. The phases of the Moon depend on its position relative to the Earth and the Sun. Read: http://www.universetoday.com/20289/phases-of-the-moon/ for more information.\n\n**Stars**\n\nStars are huge luminous balls of gas. They are powered by nuclear fusion in their cores. The different colours of stars correspond to different temperatures: blue is the hottest; red is the coldest.\n\n**Planets**\n\nPlanets are large bodies that orbit our Sun. They can be distinguished from the stars because their position changes slightly against the background stars from one night to the next, and their brightness varies in a regular cycle over a period of time. Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are most easily visible to the naked eye.\n\n**Constellations**\n\nThe International Astronomical Union recognises a total of 88 constellations in the northern and southern skies. Constellations are patterns made by connecting stars. These patterns are often tied to stories and legends. Learn more about constellations here: http://stardate.org/nightsky/constellations. \n", "fulldesc": "Preparation:\n-\tYou are encouraged to download the software Stellarium (get students involved if possible) and look for astronomical objects visible in the night sky at a given time, date and location. \n-\tPrint the sky chart, one per student, and note down the objects you would like to identify with your students. To help to identify the constellations and planets visible, you are encouraged to use a sky chart app on your smartphone. This helps identify what you are seeing just by pointing your phone to the sky.\n-\tBefore going outside, explain some of the objects that the students may see in the night sky. Please refer to the background information section.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/5d23a6d2-fd56-410d-80fb-5176c5f2a2f8/astroedu1414-milkyway-David-DeHetre.jpg)\n\n**Activity (description for students):**\n\n###Step 1:\nGo outside and look at the sky on a clear night. Before identifying any objects, list five objects you can see and write down what you know, think and feel about these objects.\n\n###Step 2:\nUsing the sky chart, identify a few objects. Next, select one object on which to base your poem. \nThis topic is what you want the reader to know more about after reading the poem. You can use the websites suggested in the background Information section or books to research the object selected. To most accurately portray your selection, you should have a basic understanding of what it is you are trying to depict through poetry.\n\n###Step 3:\nTo get some ideas flowing, write an adjective (describing word, e.g. beautiful, large, distant) before five to ten of the nouns below  (the leader of the activity may choose to exclude or add objects from the list below as desired to fit the student audience):\n\n_____________  stars\t\t______________ red giant       ____________ white dwarf\n\n______________ open star cluster    _______________ globular star cluster\n\n _______________  darkness\t_____________   planet (select any of the 8 planets)\n\n______________  Moon       _______________  sky    ____________  shooting star / meteor\n\n_____________ comet    __________________ asteroid  ________________ Kuiper Belt\n\n_____________ Nebula    _________________ Planetary Nebula  _____________ supernova\n\n_______________ spiral galaxy   ______________ barred galaxy  _____________ elliptical galaxy\n\n_______________ black hole   _______________ neutron star   ____________ quasar\n\n\n###Step 4:\nWrite down three words to describe how looking at the night sky makes you think or feel.\n\n\n###Step 4:\nTalk about different ways to tie together the facts you know about the astronomical object or topic and the things that you know, think or feel about the topic. For this step, you do not need to write the ideas as poetry, but focus on getting your ideas down on paper so that you can then reinterpret the ideas into a poem. \n\nFor example, watching the stars move across the sky above at night makes me think about how fast the Earth is rotating with me on it, and thinking about those speeds makes me realize how amazing it is that gravity lets us stay on the Earth and how small we truly are.\n\n###Step 4:\nUsing what you have done above as inspiration, now write a poem about the night sky.  \nThe poem can be in any style you like and on any topic you like as long as it is related to astronomy. You can think of the poem as taking the reader on a journey through space and in the process he or she is learning about the amazing objects zooming by. Be creative!\n\n###Step 4:\nPresent your poem to other participants. Discuss your poem and what it means. How do the sky and the objects impact you? What is your object and how is it related to astronomy.\n\n###Step 4:\nFor some inspiration you may choose to share some historical and famous poems with your students. A select few are given below.\n\n**CANIS MAJOR**  \nThe great Overdog,  \nThat heavenly beast  \nWith a star in one eye,  \nGives a leap in the east.  \nHe dances upright  \nAll the way to the west,  \nAnd never once drops  \nOn his forefeet to rest.  \nI'm a poor underdog,  \nBut tonight I will bark  \nWith the great Overdog  \nThat romps through the dark.  \n\nRobert Frost, 1928  \nThe Oxford Anthology of American Literature, Volume II, (C) 1938 by  \nOxford University Press, New York, Inc.\n\n\n**WHEN I HEARD THE LEARN'D ASTRONOMER**  \nWhen I heard the learn'd astronomer,  \nWhen the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,  \nWhen I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,  \nWhen I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,  \nHow soon unaccountable I became tired, and sick,  \nTill rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,  \nIn the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,  \nLook'd up in perfect silence at the stars.\n\nWalt Whitman, 1865 http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174747 \n\nModern examples of Astropoetry may be found at the online literary journal called Astropoetica http://astropoetica.com/ and the Astronomers Without Borders astropoetry blog http://astronomerswithoutborders.org/awb-programs/arts-and-culture/astropoetry.html. \n\nNote: You can also conduct the activity inside by showing students astronomical images, and then asking them to choose one to write a poem on.", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS3 | Physics | - | Space Physics\nUK | KS3 | English | - | Writing\nUK | KS2 | Science | - | Earth and Space\nUK | KS2 | English | - | Writing: composition\nUK | KS1 | English | - | Writing: composition", "additional_information": "- The activity also can be conducted indoors through showing astronomical images to students: http://twanight.org/\n\n- The activity can be extended for participation in the annual astropoetry contest organised by Astronomers Without Borders: http://astronomerswithoutborders.org/gam2015-programs/astroarts/1561-astropoetry-contest-for-gam2015.html\n", "conclusion": "Through the creative process of this activity, students learn to appreciate and be more aware of the night sky as well as learn more about astronomical topics.

This \u201cstored\u201d energy can be easily converted to kinetic energy, which is the energy related to the velocity and mass of a body. Furthermore, this kinetic energy is used to break the particles.\n\nFriction: Friction is the resistance to the motion of a body. It is a way to dissipate energy  (in our case to change kinetic energy to heat)  \n\nBinding energy: Binding energy is the energy required to disassemble a system into separate parts. \n\nParticle collision: In order to see inside atoms, particles and molecules, scientists hit these objects with \u201cbullet particles\u201d. If the kinetic energy of the bullets is more than the binding energy, we open the atoms, particles and  molecules and release their constituents.\n\nParticle accelerators: Particle accelerators are devices designed to reach velocities (and therefore the kinetic energy) sufficient to break the particles (see for instance, http://www.cernland.net/).\n", "fulldesc": "**This activity is done in three steps.** \n\n1) Students release steel marbles at different heights of the slide. They note that if the starting point is higher, the marbles travel further. This indicates that gravity produces kinetic energy.  \n2) They take glass marbles (usually three) bound by adhesive putty. This system represents a molecule or an atomic nucleus.  \n3) Starting from the bottom of the slide they reach the minimum height sufficient to separate the marbles when the system is released. \n\n**Preparation: **\n\nTake plastic tubes and cut it into three pieces of length ~70 cm. Two supporting parts of the main body of the tube are glued with hot glue at an angle of 90 degrees, to make a frame. The final part sits on this structure to make a slide (Figure 1).\n \n![](/media/activities/attach/846fc54b-7d75-4b0e-9cac-2af33bc86f63/astroedu1502-figure1.png)\n(Figure 1)\n\nHypothesis: \u201cEnergy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another.\u201d  \nExplanation: There are several forms of energy. Kinetic energy is related to the velocity of a body. But if I brake a car, where does this energy go?  Into heat! You can measure the temperature of the brakes after stopping. Simply rub your hands and you will convert kinetic energy into heat.\n\n###Step 1: \nStudents release steel marbles at different heights on the slide and measure the distance where they stop. The teacher should ask what happened and why. The first observation is that the higher the starting point is on the slide, the further the distance travelled by the marble before it stops.\n\n1) Gravity gives kinetic energy to each marble (more rigorously, transformation from potential to kinetic energy)  \n2) Friction stops the marble (and the energy is transformed into heat)\n\nHypothesis: \u201cObjects are bound together and we need energy to break them.\u201d\nExplanation: What happens when we drop an object (say an egg) from a height of 1 cm or 1 meter? In the first case, some damage is observed on the egg\u2019s surface, while in the second case the egg is destroyed. So, where did the kinetic energy of the egg go? Into breaking the egg.  We need a certain amount of energy to break objects, called the \u201cbinding energy\u201d.\n \n###Step 2:\nForm a clump of glass marbles using a very small amount of adhesive putty (Figure 2). This represents a molecule, an atomic nucleus or more generally a \u201csystem\u201d.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/846fc54b-7d75-4b0e-9cac-2af33bc86f63/astroedu1502-figure2.png)\n(Figure 2)\n\nWhat is the mechanism to break the bond? The bond system needs a certain amount energy to be broken, if the energy is too low, nothing happens.\n\nKeep the glass marble system at the end of the slide and then release the system (figure 3). Progressively increase the height (figure 4) until the energy is enough to separate the balls (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CHrKoGuZqQ).\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/846fc54b-7d75-4b0e-9cac-2af33bc86f63/astroedu1502-figure3.png)\n(Figure 3)\n\n ![](/media/activities/attach/846fc54b-7d75-4b0e-9cac-2af33bc86f63/astroedu1502-figure4.png)\n(Figure 4)\n\nTry various types of collisions (head-on, off-centred) with more than three marbles.\nExplain what happens. Why do the marbles separate in some cases?\n\n###Step 3:\nIn some cases, the binding of the marbles is so strong, that it needs to be released from a higher point, possibly taking too much space in the classroom. Alternatively, another source of energy can be used to break the bound.

Together with hundreds of thousands of asteroids (boulders) and comets, these celestial bodies orbit the Sun.\n\nThe Earth is a very special planet among these celestial bodies. It is our home! And the only world we know to have life on it. In order to understand its uniqueness, children need to compare the Earth to the other planets in the Solar System. As the Earth is located about 150 million kilometres from the Sun, the temperature is exactly right for liquid water to be present on the surface, unlike on most other planets. This proved crucial for the development of life!\n\nThe Solar System as a whole is part of the Milky Way Galaxy, a collection of about 200 billion stars that are arranged in a spiral, along with gas and dust. Billions of these stars have planets and these, in turn, have moons. This suggests that we are probably not alone in the Milky Way, but the distances between the stars are so big that a visit to another world is very difficult.\nEven the star nearest to us, Proxima Centauri, is 4.22 light years (i.e., over 40 trillion km) away from us. This is so distant that a journey there would take generations of human lives.\nPlanets that orbit other stars than our Sun are called extrasolar planets or exoplanets for short. Astronomers have already discovered more than 2500 of these exoplanets.\n\nWe can categorise the planets of our Solar System into two types: the rocky planets, which are nearest to the Sun and have a solid surface, and the gas giants, which are farther from the Sun and are more massive and mainly composed of gas. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars appear in the former category, and Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune make up the latter. Pluto, our formerly outermost planet, has been considered one of the dwarf planets since 2006. Between Mars and Jupiter is a so-called an asteroid belt, which circles the Sun like a ring. It consists of thousands of smaller and larger boulders. The largest of these have their own names, just like the planets. One of them, Vesta, is so large that it is also considered a dwarf planet.\n", "fulldesc": "![](/media/activities/attach/8fbe1310-324d-4a66-bcab-a56f0f8a0f77/astroedu1505-models_ZUwAHOA.jpg)\n\n###Step 1:\nThe instructor and a small group of children should initially paint the plastic spheres according to the pictures of the planets: Mercury (3.5 mm), Venus (10 mm), Earth (10 mm), Mars (5 mm), Jupiter (100 mm), Saturn (85 mm), Uranus (35 mm) and Neptune (35 mm), and Sun (150 mm).

There is a violent process going on inside our Sun. The elements within the Sun, mostly hydrogen, are burning through a process of uncontrolled nuclear fusion. During the fusion reaction, a large amount of energy is released in the form of heat and light. The surface temperature of the Sun is around 5500 degrees Celsius (~5700 Kelvin), whereas the temperature of the core is roughly 15 million degrees Celsius (~15 million Kelvin).\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/09a3cb64-c6c3-49ac-9952-07b3f7c11958/astroedu1503-sun.jpg)\n\nLight leaves the Sun at very high speeds, travelling at a distance of 300 000 000 metres in 1 second (i.e. 299 792.458 kilometres or 186 282.397 miles in 1 second). This is the fastest speed known to humans on Earth. Despite the fact that light travels so fast, it still takes around 8 minutes to reach us. This is because the Sun is very far away from us. The distance to the Sun from the Earth is around 149 600 000 km (149 million kilometres) or 92 960 000 miles (92 million miles).\n\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/09a3cb64-c6c3-49ac-9952-07b3f7c11958/astroedu1503-fusion.jpg) \n*Image: Fusion of two atoms: a visual of the physics behind nuclear reactions and the energy behind light rays.*\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/09a3cb64-c6c3-49ac-9952-07b3f7c11958/astroedu1503-window.jpg)\n\nOne interesting phenomenon that takes place with the Sun is the Analemma. An Analemma is the changing angular offset of a celestial body when observed from another body (e.g. observing the Sun from the Earth or observing the Earth from the Moon). Usually the movement of the observed body is seen to change at regular intervals, such as daily or yearly. In most cases, the Analemma diagram is used for the Sun but can also be used for other bodies.\n\nIf a person were to record the position of the Sun everyday at exactly the same time (for example 12 noon) for a period of 30 to 50 days, a very interesting pattern emerges. The Sun forms a figure 8 in the sky because of the slight elliptical orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the axial tilt of the Earth (23.5 degrees). The highest point of the Analemma is observed in summer and the lowest point is observed in winter. It should be noted that the shape made by the Analemma changes depending on the observed body (e.g. if we observed the Sun from Mars, we would see a tear drop/egg shaped Analemma.) \n\nThe Analemma phenomenon helps us to understand why shadows change over the course of the year despite observations made at the same time each day. This highlights the fact that our Earth has an axial tilt and has an elliptic orbit. It also shows that the variations change in different hemispheres, e.g. when the Northern Hemisphere has the lowest point observed (indicating winter), it corresponds to the highest point observed in the Southern Hemisphere (indicating summer).   \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/09a3cb64-c6c3-49ac-9952-07b3f7c11958/astroedu1503-analemma.jpg)\n \nAs we have seen earlier, light rays from the Sun reach us and when they hit an object (e.g. trees, buildings, people and animals.) they cast a shadow. The object blocks some of the sunlight and causes the shadow. However, when the object is transparent (such as a glass window), the sunlight goes through it. If the Sun\u2019s rays are incident on an object, the shadow is oriented away from the Sun. The shadow length changes through the course of a day as well as through the year, for example, a noon shadow is much shorter in summer than in winter. \n\nThroughout history, human kind has relied on the Sun and Moon as astronomical time keeping devices. The first known records were from the ancient Egyptians, although it is believed that time keeping existed well beyond 6000 years, but most records were lost. Various civilizations had accurate time keeping devices and utilized a calendar system that is much like the one we use today (a 365 day cycle, with 12 months of 29 to 30 days). They used the Sun, Moon and stars, or a combination thereof, to depict the time of year. They also used various types of sundials to keep track of the time of day, and the stars to calculate the time at night when sundials could not be used. \n \nExamples of time keeping devices from the past include sundials, astronomical clocks, obelisks, water and sand clocks (like the hour glass), candle and incense clocks, mechanical clocks, and more recently quartz and atomic clocks. It is worth mentioning that even today astronomy has played a key role in time keeping. In today\u2019s age, the discovery of the millisecond pulsar, a type of neutron star, is more accurate than the atomic clock. (Note: Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars formed as a result of a supernova explosion).", "fulldesc": "**Before the Activity:**\n  \nAsk the students what would happen if this activity were carried out on a cloudy or rainy day.\nAsk the students why they think it is important to measure the shadow length in relation to the Sun.\n\n##Main Activity:\n\n###Step 1: \nBegin the activity in the morning and ask the children to look at various objects that cast a shadow.

Or is it the same season all around the world?  \n(For example, if it is Summer, ask the children if they think it is summer all around the world? If they say no, ask them why. If the students do not know, then refer to the post activity experiment section). \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/09a3cb64-c6c3-49ac-9952-07b3f7c11958/astroedu1503-shadow-stick.jpg)\n \n###Step 4: \nRepeat step 3 over different periods of the day (e.g. twice before noon, at noon, twice before sunset). Also ask the children to note how the sun is moving across the sky each time the experiment is carried out.\n\n##Post Activity:##\n\n###Step 1: \nAsk the children to write out and draw their findings at the end of the day and discuss their observations in groups. Have the students compare the measurements from the day and make a conclusion from their findings.\n\n###Step 2: \nHave the groups present their findings to the class and engage in a discussion with the instructor/teacher. Have the students compare their findings with the different groups and discuss with the instructor/teacher.\n\n###Step 3: \nRepeat the exercise in the next season over the period of one year. \nDid the shadows at noon get bigger? This will be the case if the season got colder (e.g., from autumn to winter). Did the shadows at noon get smaller? This will be the case if the season got warmer (e.g., from winter to spring).\n\n##Post Activity Experiment:##\n- Use the Earth model (or ball to represent the Earth) and flashlight to demonstrate how the Earth revolves around the Sun. \n- Tilt the ball/globe on an axis to demonstrate how the Earth receives different amounts of sunlight as the Earth makes one revolution around the Sun. \n\nThis should enable the students to visualise why each hemisphere has opposite seasons. It should also help students visualise what causes the seasons and its changes.

These planets orbit around the Sun and present variations in size and composition. The Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy along with a vast number of stars. The great distances between the stars are almost unimaginable along with the location of the Solar System in the Universe. Compared to these distances, the planets of the Solar System are close, but compared to distances on Earth, it becomes difficult to visualize them. The distance between Pluto and the Sun is about 5.9 billion kilometers!\n\nSun and planets in the solar system: (teachers are encouraged to share these information while conducting the activity)\n\n* The Sun is the closest star to Earth consisting of electrically charged particles and mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. More than one million Earths could fit into it. The Sun is a middle sized star powered by nuclear fusion. It takes about 8 minutes for the sunlight to reach Earth after being emitted from its surface.\n\n* Mercury is the nearest planet to the Sun and also the smallest in size. Since the planet lacks of an atmosphere, it experiences both hot and cold extreme temperatures. Out of all the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, Mercury is the densest planet.\n\n* Venus is the hottest planet of the Solar System and is very close in size to Earth. The planet possesses a very dense atmosphere of mainly carbon dioxide that causes it to reach the highest temperatures of all the planets (740 Kelvins at the surface while Earth is about 290 Kelvins!). Venus is nearly covered by a thick layer of sulphuric acid clouds that prevent the solar rays to penetrate in the atmosphere below.\n\n* Earth is the only planet known so far to support life. It has a magnetic field that extends thousands of kilometers into space and protects the planet from harmful incoming solar radiation. The planet is located at the center of what astronomers call the habitable zone, where temperatures are suitable enough for water to exist in its liquid state.\n\n* Mars presents frozen water in its polar caps. Several flybys, landers, orbiters, and rovers have been sent to Mars to study the planet. However, one of the biggest questions about the planet still remains open: did water ever exist on Mars?\n\n* Jupiter is the largest planet of the Solar System and is the first among the gaseous planets. It contains more than twice the mass of all the planets of the Solar System together. The planet is so large enough that 1400 Earths can fit into it.\n\n* Saturn is well known for its bright rings. Saturn needs about 30 Earth years to orbit the Sun but only about 11 hours to rotate around its axis. Its rings are composed of billions of icy and rocky materials.\n\n* Uranus is known as an ice giant planet since is composed of relatively great amounts icy methane and water. Uranus rotation axis is tilted almost parallel to its orbital plane while the rest of the planets spin more or less perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.\n\n* Neptune is the most distant planet of the Solar System. It is roughly half as far from Uranus as Uranus is from the Sun. Like Uranus, Neptune has rings that are thin and which consequently appear very dim when observed.\n\nOther bodies:\n* The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and it was visited for the first time by the Apollo 11 landing mission in 1969. The dark and relatively featureless lunar areas that can be clearly  seen with the naked eye are called maria, which are known to be the result of ancient balsatic lava.\n\n* The asteroid belt is a region of the Solar System found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter and it is occupied by asteroids of different shapes and sizes. Asteroids are rocky-metallic objects which are also called planetoids or minor planets because they are too small (they can range from the size of pebbles to ~ 1000 km).\n\n* Comets are icy small bodies that have a wide range of orbital periods. When passing close to the Sun, comets heat up and outgas material giving it the shape of a snowball with a tail. They are known to have a wide range of orbital periods.\n\n* Pluto is a dwarf planet found in the Solar System. Since its discovery in 1930, Pluto remained classified as a planet until the detection of the more massive body Eris put it in question. In 2006, the definiton of  a planet stated by the International Astronomical Union excluded Pluto since it failed to clear out the neighbourhood objects from its orbit.\n\nAstronomical unit (au):\nIs a unit of length, approximately the distance between the Earth and the Sun, astronomers use to describe the great distances in the Solar System.\n\nThe scale factor:\n\nIn a scale model, all linear distances and sizes are enlarged or reduced by a scaling factor. The scale factor is given by;\nscale factor = true value/reference value\n\nFor example, when scaling the Solar System, the diameter of Earth and the reference size (in this case is a peppercorn of 2 mm) could be used as the true and reference values, respectively. In order to scale the rest of the planets, their true sizes and the scale factor calculated above are used:\n\nscale model = true value/scale factor\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/ba24077f-cf37-4f13-86d8-a0c07e0e7b46/astroedu1512-map.jpg)\nExample of a scaled model of the Solar System on the city map of Munich showing the orbits of  Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune around the Sun (located at the city center in Marienplatz, Munich, Germany).", "fulldesc": "The activity consists of engaging students to build a reduced-scale model of the Solar System. It is very difficult to visualize the great empty space that exists between the planets and the Sun and to realize how big or small these are relative to each other. The following steps may help in the realization of the scale model:\n\n\n###Step 1:\nInvolve students in an introductory discussion about the Solar System:\n\n* Ask students where in the Milky Way galaxy is the Sun located (this can be done by showing an image of the Milky Way galaxy).\n* Which star is the closest to Earth?\n* How close is the next nearest star to Earth? Nearest planet to Earth?\n* Which other bodies can be found in the Solar System?\n* How big are the Solar System bodies relative to each other? How far apart are they? Are there other differences between them? In which two big categories are the planets divided?\n* How could we represent these values on Earth? Have students bring any suggestions on how to represent such distances and sizes at a lower scale.\n* Ask students to list characteristics of scale models, write responses on the board and discuss until having the correct answer.  The list should have all linear dimensions (e.g. width, height, length, \u2026)\nThis discussion may help bringing students to realize the difficulties of understanding the large numerical values of the Solar System bodies and drive them to intuitively think about a scale model.   \n  \n###Step 2: \nEngage students in predicting the model:\n\n* Divide students into different groups.\n* Ask students which parameters are required to scale the Solar System.\n* Have students make predictions without using calculations about the scale model by positioning their estimated scaled model on the map (taking into account the distances shown on the map) and creating or identifying a size for each Solar System body.\n* What could be done to have a more accurate representation of the Solar System?\n* Discuss about their predicted model and any misconceptions found.\n\nBy the end of this step, students should be able to understand that both distance and size are required to build a scale model.\n\n###Step 3: \nHave students build a scale model based on calculations\n\n* Provide a worksheet containing the distances between Solar System bodies and their sizes to each group of students.\n* Challenge students to brainstorm on how these data could be combined to build a model.\n* Give examples by scaling objects found in the classroom and using simple calculations (this could be done by re-sizing a pen to twice its size or reducing the distance between two students by twice) to show how to use a scaling factor.\n* Provide a peppercorn (or any round object of 2 mm) to each group to be used as the representation of Earth.\n* Let students determine what calculations are involved in order to construct the scale model. What is the new size of Venus given that Earth is scaled to 2 mm? How can we use this information to also scale the distances between the objects and the Sun?\n* Have students complete the Student Worksheet. For the scale size, students also identify the rest of the planets using the common objects provided or create them using the play dough or aluminum foil based on their calculations.\n* Have students compare the relative sizes and distances of the different planets from their predicted model and the actual model (students should see that science is not about knowing the right answer at first).\n* Optionally, mention the definition of astronomical units and the reason astronomers make use of them. Write the distances between the Sun and some of the planets for students to convert them to kilometers.\n\n###Step 4: \nLet students build a scale model on a city map and extend to other scenarios\n\n* Have students position the planets and the Sun on a city map. A map containing a scale indicating the actual distances may be used along with a metric ruler to place the planets.\n* If possible, ask students to look for the actual position of the planets relative to each other. This information can be obtained, for example, from: http://www.theplanetstoday.com A compass may be used to draw the orbits.\n* Discuss results with students and ask for or provide specific facts about the Sun and planets.\n* Ask students what characteristics of the planets are not taken into account in the model and how would the model be impacted if only distances are scaled. What factors can contribute to the inaccuracy of the model? How can this be corrected?\n* Engage students thinking about other kinds of scale models (for example, used in other disciplines) and how could they apply the same procedure to build a model.\n\n###Step 5: \nOrganize a walk with students to the different locations of the Solar System bodies on a city map\n* Motivate students to go on a journey through the Solar System.\n* Hand the Sun and the planets to students before starting the walk.\n* Make sure most students are more or less familiarized with the locations placed on the map.\n* Feel free to separate students into different groups to represent each body and stand on their location while the rest reach the next. This step depends on the city type you are located and it is more suitable on a long straight street.\n* When reaching to the different locations, ask students facts and characteristics about each of the bodies. Relate the planets' orbital periods to their distances to the Sun (the further away they are, the larger the orbital period).", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS3 | Maths | - | Ratio, proportion and rates of change: scale factors\nUK | GCSE | Maths | AQA | 3.3 Ratio, proportion and rates of change: R2, R12 scale factors\nUK | GCSE | Maths | Edexcel | 3.3 Ratio, proportion and rates of change: R2 scale factors\nUK | GCSE | Maths | OCR | 10.

Too much light pollution has consequences: it washes out starlight in the night sky, interferes with astronomical research, disrupts ecosystems, has adverse health effects and wastes energy.\n\nA little more than 100 years ago, you could walk outside at night even in a city and see the Milky Way galaxy arch across the night sky. Being able to see thousands of stars was part of everyday life, inspiring artists like Van Gogh, musical composers like Holst and writers like Shakespeare. By allowing artificial lights to wash out our starry night skies, we are losing touch with our cultural heritage (e.g., what has made us who we are). We are also losing touch with what could inspire future generations.\n\nWith more than half of the world\u2019s population now living in cities, most people have never experienced the wonderment of pristinely dark skies. How do you explain the importance of what they\u2019ve lost to light pollution? How can you make them aware that light pollution is a concern on many fronts: safety, energy conservation, cost, health and effects on wildlife, as well as our ability to view the stars? Finally, how do you convince them that it\u2019s worthwhile to take even small steps, to help fix this problem?\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c65d624-bc36-44be-8ac6-187f236aaa12/Iberian-peninsula-nasa.jpg)\n(Image credit: NASA)\n\n**Effects of Light Pollution**\n\nIn disrupting ecosystems, light pollution poses a serious threat in particular to nocturnal wildlife, having negative impacts on plant and animal physiology. It can confuse the migratory patterns of animals, alter competitive interactions of animals, change predator-prey relations, and cause physiological harm. The rhythm of life is orchestrated by the natural diurnal patterns of light and dark; so disruption to these patterns impacts the ecological dynamics.\n\nWith respect to adverse health effects, many species, especially humans, are dependent on natural body cycles called circadian rhythms and the production of melatonin, which are regulated by light and dark (e.g., day and night). If humans are exposed to light while sleeping, melatonin production can be suppressed. This can lead to sleep disorders and other health problems such as increased headaches, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, some forms of obesity due to lack of sleep and increased anxiety. Ties are being found to a couple of types of cancer and there are also effects of glare on aging eyes. (See text below.) Health effects are not only due to over-illumination or excessive exposure of light over time, but also improper spectral composition of light (i.e. certain colours of light).\n\nWith respect to energy wastage, lighting is responsible for at least a quarter of all electricity consumption worldwide. Over illumination can constitute energy wastage, especially upward directed lighting at night.  Energy wastage is also a waste in cost and increases our carbon footprint.\n\nThe good news is that light pollution can be reduced fairly easily by shielding lights properly, by only using light when and where it is needed, by only using the amount that is needed, by using energy efficient bulbs, and by using bulbs with appropriate spectral power distributions for the task at hand.\n\n**Going further\u2026 Three Main Types of Light Pollution**\n\nClinically speaking, the three main types of light pollution include glare, light trespass and skyglow (in addition to over-illumination and clutter). **Glare** from unshielded lighting is a public-health hazard\u2014especially the older you become. Glare light scattering in the eye causes loss of contrast, sometimes blinds you temporarily and leads to unsafe driving conditions, for instance. **Light trespass** occurs when unwanted light enters one\u2019s property, for example, by shining unwanted light into a bedroom window of a person trying to sleep. **Skyglow** refers to the glow effect that can be seen over populated areas. Skyglow is the combination of all the reflected light and upward-directed (unshielded) light escaping up into the sky (and for the most part, unused). Shielding lights significantly reduces all three of these types of light pollution.\nThis exercise means to raise awareness of the impact on light pollution within students. \n\n**Preparation**\n\nThe Stellarium software should be downloaded and be available to the students. It will also need to be projected. http://www.stellarium.org/en_GB/ \nThe Stellarium FAQ contains a user-guide: http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ  \nAs the teacher you will also require Excel to collate and plot the data. \n\n*Tip: You can obtain your geographic coordinates from google maps and enter them into Stellarium. This will give you a view of the local night sky.*\n\nTo inspire the students, the teacher is encouraged to give an introduction to the concept of light pollution. The background information section contains pertinent information. It is recommended to show images of Earth viewed from the ISS provided and the time-lapse videos as well.\n\n- Image: Iberian Peninsula at Night http://www.nasa.gov/content/iberian-peninsula-at-night/#.VPciDfmsX-U\n- Time-lapse video: https://vimeo.com/78978601\n\n", "fulldesc": "Introduce the activity to the students and ask them to observe and measure the data. *Worksheet* needs to be distributed to students prior to this class, so they can do their respective observations. It is recommended to distribute the worksheet several days before class in order to allow students to observe on a night with good weather conditions.\n\n###Step 1:\nCut out black cardboard with the dimensions shown in the figure below.\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c65d624-bc36-44be-8ac6-187f236aaa12/blackcard-board.jpg)\n*Worksheet*\n\n###Step 2:\nDuring a dark night step outside. Hold the cardboard at arm\u2019s length. Looking only at the cropped area, try to count the highest number of stars that you can see.

Because of:\n\n- City lights (even if we are in an urban region);\n- The pollution from industry;\n- The clouds;\n- The moonlight;\n- Volcano activity;\n- The atmosphere\n\n###Step 7: \nOpen the Stellarium software. Choose *Sky and window options* [F4]. In the \u201cAtmosphere\u201d area, select a value for artificial light. With the students\u2019 help, ask them to match the projected image as close to the sky night observed as possible. This can be done by counting the observed stars in a fixed area (i.e. a constellation), for example.\n\n*Tip: To simulate dark-sky conditions, the class-room should have the lights off and be as dark as possible.*\n\n###Step 8: \nNow add light to the classroom (i.e. turn on the over-head lights, open blinds) and ask students to describe what they observe.\n\n###Step 9: \nThis example should have illustrated the effect of light on the amount of stars we can observe. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c65d624-bc36-44be-8ac6-187f236aaa12/stellarium-screen.jpg)\n\n###Step 10:\nDivide the students into groups of 3. Students will conduct research on the Internet to answer some of the questions.\n\nYou have been able to observe that the higher artificial light, the lower the possibility to look at our universe.\n\n- Discuss with your teammates which are the main causes of light pollution: a) natural causes; b) anthropogenic causes. Write down your answers.\n\n- Now it\u2019s up to you! Come up with ideas to reduce light pollution. Here are some possible answers: \n\nGood lighting: | Bad lighting: |\n-|-|-|\n- Lamp is on a motion sensor, so only turns on when it is needed. | \u2022 Fixtures that are unshielded contribute to light pollution. \n- Glare from bright, direct light of a lamp can create unsafe situations for drivers who do not see pedestrians, for instance. | \u2022 Light from an unshielded fixture is directed upward and will not be used where it is needed on the ground. \n- Lamp is on a timer so not operating from dusk to dawn, but only when it is needed. | \n- Lamp is partially shielded. Partially shielded lighting puts light where it\u2019s needed & minimizes glare and energy waste. If your lamp is shielded, you can lower the wattage of your bulb and save energy and cost.

It is also found in fizzy drinks; in cakes, which rise thanks to the CO<sub>2</sub> produced by baking powder; and when organic compounds such as paraffin, paper, wood or petroleum are burned. Geysers can be driven by carbon dioxide, as well as steam. In liquid form, it is used in fire extinguishers and as a refrigerant in the food industry (for example to store and transport ice cream). \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/835c3673-921b-406a-8491-0a8efb3ae582/astroedu1601-Geisers-Del-Tatio-Close-Up.JPG) \nImage: Close-up to one of the geysers in \"El Tatio\" in San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. Credit: AndresGottlieb\n\nIn high concentrations, CO<sub>2</sub> can become dangerous for humans and other animals, but it is also a source of life: during photosynthesis, plants use CO<sub>2</sub> and light to produce sugar, starch, fats, and proteins, as well as the oxygen we need to survive. *A volume per cent or vol% is the number of cubic centimetres of a substance (usually oxygen or carbon dioxide) contained in 100 ml of another substance (for example blood).  \n\nNote: The amounts of carbon dioxide produced in these activities are not high enough to be dangerous. \n\n**CO<sub>2</sub> properties**\n \nCarbon dioxide is colourless. At low concentrations, the gas is odourless. At higher concentrations it has a sharp, acidic odour. At standard temperature and pressure, the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98 kg/m<sup>3</sup>; this is about 1.67 times more than air. CO<sub>2</sub> is present in very small quantities in the air, which makes it hard to keep as one layer. Gases don\u2019t stay still but move around in the air. CO<sub>2</sub> then doesn\u2019t remain on the lower parts of the atmosphere even though it is heavier than air.  \n\n**Detection of CO<sub>2</sub> with lime water** \n\nThe lime water test to detect CO<sub>2</sub> was developed by chemist Joseph Black (1728\u20131799). Lime water is a solution of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime). When carbon dioxide is bubbled through it, a solid precipitate of calcium carbonate is formed. Calcium carbonate is chalk or limestone, and it is this that makes the lime water cloudy. \n\ncalcium hydroxide  +  carbon dioxide  ->  calcium carbonate  +  water.  \n Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(aq)          +      CO<sub>2</sub>(g)                CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s)            +  H<sub>2</sub>O(l) \n", "fulldesc": "The first six steps are common to both activities A and B\u2013 then you have two options as to how to proceed. \n\n###Step 1:\nBlow up a balloon and let the air out again to make the rubber more elastic. \n\n###Step 2:\nUse the funnel to fill the balloon with a packet of baking powder (20 g) or five crushed effervescent tablets. \n\n###Step 3:\nPour 2-3 cm of water into the bottle. \n\n###Step 4:\nCover the bottleneck with the balloon and tip the baking soda / effervescent tablets into the bottle. You may need to hold the balloon onto the bottleneck to prevent it from slipping off.\n\n###Step 5:\nShake the bottle lightly. The balloon fills with a gas that is produced in the effervescence. \n\n###Step 6:\nWhen the balloon has stopped inflating, twist it shut so that no gas can escape and pull it off the bottle. \n\nAsk students to describe what is happening. Ask them to share their hypotheses about what caused the balloon to fill. Discuss the hypotheses before going to part A.  \n\n**A) What type of gas is it?** \n\n###Step 7:\nPut some lime water into a beaker. \n\n###Step 8:\nPlace a drinking straw into the mouth of the balloon, and slowly and carefully release the gas from the balloon into the lime water. The lime water will become cloudy. \n\n###Step 9:\nRepeat step 7 with clear water.  \n\nAsk students to draw the two different beakers and illustrate their observations. Why is the water clear and the lime water cloudy? What could cause the clouds in the lime water?  \n\nDiscuss the answers with the students.  What conclusion can we make?

See also the general safety note.* \n\nThe gas in the balloon is CO<sub>2</sub>. Where did our CO<sub>2</sub> come from? Both baking powder and effervescent tablets contain sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and a solid acid (such as citric acid crystals or monocalcium phosphate). In contact with water, sodium bicarbonate and the acid react with one another, ultimately forming water and CO<sub>2</sub>. This gas is what forms the bubbles when a fizzy tablet dissolves. In our daily lives, it is also what makes cakes rise. \n\n**B) The gas is heavy **\n\n###Step 7:\nHold the mouth of the balloon into a beaker and let the gas flow out. You cannot see anything, but we will see whether anything has happened. Put the beaker to one side. \n\n###Step 8:\nLight a tea light candle and use a pair of tongs to place it in a second, empty, beaker (alternatively, you could stick a wooden skewer into the wax and use that to lift the tea light candle into the beaker). It should continue to burn. \n\n###Step 9:\nNow place the tea light in the first beaker, which contains the gas from the balloon. The candle should stop burning because the gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) will choke the flame. Ask students to draw the experiment and note their observations. Discuss their notes. What caused the flame to extinguish in the first beaker?  \n\n###Step 10:\nRepeat steps 1-7 to collect more CO<sub>2</sub> in a beaker. Now pour the invisible contents of this beaker into yet another empty beaker. Place a burning tea light into this beaker. What happens? Again, the flame is extinguished, showing that we were able to pour the gas from one beaker to another, as though it were a liquid.  \n\nAsk students to draw the experiment and note their observations. Discuss the results with the students. What conclusions can we draw from this experiment?  \n\nThis experiment demonstrates that CO<sub>2</sub> is heavier than air. Ask students what would have happened if CO<sub>2</sub> were lighter than air.  \n\nAsk students if they can think of daily applications of this property.

That is why the Sun appears to rise from the East and set in the West. Only half of the globe is facing the Sun at any one time, but because the Earth rotates in 24 hours all of the Earth has faced the Sun during this time. In the part lit by the Sun, it is day. The other side of the globe is in the shadow and does not receive the light of the Sun. In this part of the Earth, it is night. As the axis of the Earth is tilted, days and nights are not equal: day and night do not last 12 hours each but their length changes over the year as the Earth rotates around the Sun and its position changes.  \n \n**Nocturnal animals** \n\nBy definition a nocturnal animal is an animal that is active during the night and sleeps during the day contrary to diurnal animals. Many of these animals are nocturnal to avoid the heat of the day, like desert animals. These animals have natural adaptations to help them live in the dark. They can for example have very good hearing (rabbits), smell, or eyes (owls, cats). These are natural adaptations allowing them to live or hunt during the night. \n\n**Global citizenship** \n\nSpeaking about the Earth as a globe is an opportunity to give students a sense of global citizenship. We all live on the same tiny blue planet floating around in the vast emptiness of space. Everyone on this planet sees the same Moon and the same Sun in the same sky, and experiences days and nights. Dealing with astronomy is identical for any human being. The realisation that we all share this little sphere as our home and have the same experiences bonds us as a species and makes us think about how we can work together to cherish the only safe haven in space that we have. \n", "fulldesc": "###Preparation \n\nThis resource Day and Night is divided into four activities. For the activity 'Animals in the night' you will need the photographs of diurnal and nocturnal animals from the Appendix. For the activity \u2018Children in the world\u2019, cut 24 squares of paper, the same size as the square on the cut-out sheet. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/2f0c3fe9-9d7e-4a5f-8c35-a6758fcc7ea2/earth-sun.jpg) \n\n###Animals in the night\n\nSit in a circle with the students. Place the photographs of the diurnal and nocturnal animals in the middle of the circle. Ask if animals sleep at night, just like people. Which animals don't sleep at night? When are they awake?  \n\nRemove the photographs of the diurnal animals. Look at the photographs of the nocturnal animals and talk about how you can recognise a nocturnal animal. Come to the conclusion that nocturnal animals often have bigger eyes than diurnal animals so that they can see better at night. Sometimes they have adapted in other ways as well.  \n\nNocturnal animals can be recognised by specific features, because they live in the dark. The nocturnal animals in the photographs are the bat, the owl, the hedgehog, and the panther.  \n\n*Good to know*\n\nBats have such poor eyesight that they do not find their prey by looking with their eyes but by emitting ultrasonic sounds. This sound is reflected from the prey back to their ears. This tells them the distance to their prey. Owls have strikingly large eyes. This means they can see their prey clearly at night. A panther has eyes with a reflective layer. This enables them to make optimal use of the little light during the night.  \n\n###Children in the world\n\nGive each student a paper square, a pair of scissors, and colouring pencils. Students complete Task 1 on the worksheet. Read the instructions together and look at the example. Explain that they need to fold the paper into a triangle. They fold this triangle in half, and in half again. At the top of the folded paper they draw a child as shown in the example on the worksheet. Then they cut this out. Make sure the students only cut the outside of the paper (that they do not cut the centre point).  \n\nThe circle in the middle of the paper should remain intact. When the paper is unfolded, the students will see a planet with a group of children holding hands all around it. Explain that this represents all the children on Earth. Get everyone to colour in two opposite children in two different colours. Explain that one child lives in Europe and the other in Australia. Australia is all the way around the other side of the world.  \n\n###Day and night in the world I\n\nGive each child an embroidery needle and a split pin. Students complete Task 2 on the worksheet (print the cutout sheet on thick paper, instead of A4 paper, to avoid tearing). Ask students not to cut out the small black circle in the middle. The students place the square over the world with the children from Task 1. They use the embroidery needle to prick a hole in the black circle and a hole in the centre of the world from task 1. They place the square over the children of the world and fasten the two together with a split pin.  \n\nDemonstrate how it works. The students see that half of the world is covered by the semi-circle. The students turn the uppermost circle around and see that when it is day for the child in Europe it is night in Australia and vice-versa. Ask where it is light when it is dark in Europe. Turn the uppermost circle a little at a time. Can the children see that it is night at a different place on the planet at each time? If it is day for the child in Europe, what is it for the child in Australia? Use this to make it clear to the students that when it is day for us, it is night on the other side of the world.  \n\n*Good to know.* Light always travels in a straight line. It is unable to travel around an object. The Earth turns on its own axis once in every 24 hours, and during this time the Sun only shines on the half of the Earth that is facing the Sun. On the other side of the planet it is then night. So we have day and night because the Earth turns on its own axis.  \n\n###Day and night in the world II\nTake an orange or a globe. Explain to the students that you are going to stick a sticker or a cocktail stick in it to show Europe and one to show Australia. Who knows where the stickers/sticks should go? Stick a piece of tape on the stick for Europe so you can tell them apart. Take a torch and say this represents the Sun. Make it dark in the classroom so the light of the torch shows up clearly. Ask the children from which direction the torch needs to shine if it is night in Australia. And if it is night in Europe? Come to the conclusion that it is night there because the Sun is not shining on that side of the Earth.  \n\nRepeat the same steps comparing the northern latitudes in Europe, and the Arctic Circle, to Southern Europe. Show that sometimes (in Summer), northern latitudes have shorter nights than in the south. Ask students if they ever experienced that when travelling.  \n\nEmphasise what the students have learnt during this lesson by showing an entire day and night. Start with the Sun coming up. Show that the Sun makes it light in Europe. Show that this also means that it is dark on the other side of the world. It is night there. Turn the orange or globe. Show the students that at a certain moment the Sun is no longer shining on Europe. It is now night. The Sun is shining on the other side of the world. Compare this with what the students saw in Task 2.  \n\nShow the orange or globe with the light on one side. Ask students to stick the pictures of diurnal and nocturnal animals on the orange or globe at the time they would be active.  Ask students where they would place themselves on the orange at the time you are doing the activity. Ask what would children living on the dark side of the orange be doing at the same time.   \n\nExplain that all humans share the same planet and that everyone on this planet sees the same Moon and the same Sun in the same sky, and experience days and nights at different moments.", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n-|-|-|-|-\nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Science | - | Earth and space: use the idea of the Earth\u2019s rotation to explain day and night and the apparent movement of the sun across the sky. \nUK | KS2: Year 3 | Science | - | Light: recognise that they need light in order to see things and that dark is the absence of light. \nUK | KS2: Year 4 | Science | - | Living things and their habitats: recognise that living things can be grouped in a variety of ways.

One of the first instruments to give the time was the sundial, which used the sun\u2019s motion.  \n\nAnother instrument is used in the activity. The hourglass measures the passage of time. It is made of two different compartments, often glass bulbs, connected by a narrow tube, allowing sand or other material to go from the upper to lower compartment at a constant speed\u2014thus in a given time. An hourglass works by gravity pulling on the sand so that it falls downwards. Nowadays, we can use a stopwatch to measure the time between when it is activated and when it is deactivated.  \n", "fulldesc": "![](/media/activities/attach/e54288f3-6684-49f8-ae9e-3592a083950e/astroEDU1606-hour-glass-image.jpg) \n\n###Preparation \nTo make an hourglass you will need to make sure the sand is dry. The bottles also need to be dry and light. Make sure the mouths of each pair of bottles are the same size. Place the materials for the hourglass (bottles, pencils, pieces of card, scissors, sticky tape, and sand) ready at the front of the classroom.   \n\n###Activity 1: How long does a minute last?  \n\n###Step 1: \nAsk the question: What is time? Can you tell what time it is without agreeing on some things beforehand?  \n\n###Step 2:\nOrganise the students into pairs. Explain that they are going to see how long 1 minute takes. Give student 1 a stopwatch. Student 1 gives a signal when he/she starts the stopwatch. When student 2 thinks that 1 minute has passed, he/she gives a signal and student 1 stops the stopwatch. How much time does the stopwatch show?  \n\n###Step 3:\nExplain that they are going to repeat the experiment. Now they have to think of a way to help them make a more accurate estimate of when 1 minute has passed. They could count, or draw lines. Encourage the students to try out their suggestions; then discuss how successful the experiment was. Were they able to make a better estimate the second time? What did they use to help them?  \n\n###Step 4:\nThe students complete Task 1 on the worksheet.\n\n###Step 5:\nAsk why they think it is important to know how much time has passed. And why is it important to make agreements about time? Come to the conclusion that it is important that everyone uses the same definition when they refer to time. This makes sure we arrive on time for an appointment, for example.\n\n###Step 6:\nAsk the question: \u2018What ways of measuring time do you know?\u2019 If necessary, add the following to their ideas: stopwatch, looking at the position of the sun, or using an hourglass (egg-timer).   \n\n###Activity 2: Make an hourglass\n\n###Step 1:\nExplain that an hourglass works by gravity pulling on the sand so that it falls downwards. Gravity pulls objects towards the centre of the Earth. This happens at a constant speed when we consider a small distance like in an hourglass, so an hourglass is a reliable way to measure time. \n\n*Good to know.* Long ago sailors used an hourglass to ring the ship's bell every hour and half hour. Doctors used a 15-second hourglass to measure their patients' pulse.  \n\n###Step 2:\nOrganise the students into pairs. The students examine the materials you have prepared at the front of the classroom and decide how they will use these to make their hourglass. Give each pair of students a pencil. Assist them by asking what an hourglass looks like. What is inside it? And how can this \u2018flow\u2019? The students complete Task 2 on the worksheet, up to step 5.\n\n###Step 3:\nAn example of how you could make an hourglass: cut out a cardboard circle that fits between the mouths of the two bottles. Make a small hole in the centre of the card. Pour some sand in one of the bottles. Place the card on the mouth of the bottle, and place the second bottle upside down on the first. Stick them together at the middle using sticky tape. Make sure that the bottles used for the hourglass are light to make a stable assembly.   \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e54288f3-6684-49f8-ae9e-3592a083950e/astroEDU1606-hour-glass-drawing.jpg) \n\n###Step 4:\nLook at the drawings showing the students' ideas. Do they look like they will work? Ask the students how much sand they will use, how large will they make the hole in the card, and how will they fix the bottles together. Note: the larger the hole, the less time it takes for all the sand to run through it. The more sand there is in the bottle, the more time it takes to all pass through the hole. This experiment will only work if the bottles and the sand are perfectly dry. \n\n###Step 5:\nOnce the students have created a good picture of their design, they can make their hourglass. \n\n###Step 6:\nThe students test their hourglasses to see if they work properly. The worksheet contains some tips on how they can improve their design. Now they complete step 5 of Task 2 on the worksheet. Each hourglass will take a different length of time to empty. Explain that this has to do with the size of their hole and the amount of sand they used. \n\n\n###Activity 3: Use your hourglass\n\n###Step 1:\nTake the students to the playground and encourage them to use their own hourglass to measure how long it takes them to run a certain distance. Mark a start and finish line. One student from each pair gets ready to run. The other student waits for the starting signal, and then turns over their hourglass.\n\n###Step 2:\nHow long did it take for the student to cross the finish line? Could they measure it with their hourglass? Was there enough sand to measure the time? Ask the students to swap places and repeat the task.\n\n###Step 3:\nThe students return to the classroom to complete Task 3 on the worksheet. \n\n###Step 4:\nDiscuss these tasks. Come to the conclusion that it is difficult to measure the exact time with an hourglass. If the hourglass is only partially empty, you can only guess how much time has passed.", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n-|-|-|-|-\nUK | KS1 | Science | - | Working scientifically: using their observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions.\nUK | KS1: Year 2 | Science | - | Use of everyday materials: identify and compare the suitability of a variety of everyday materials.\nUK | KS2: Years 3 and 4 | Science | - | Working scientifically: using results to draw simple conclusions, make predictions for new values, suggesting improvements and raising further questions.\nUK | KS1: Year 1 | Maths | \u2013 | Measurement: compare, describe and solve practical problems for time; measure and begin to record time. \nUK | KS1: Year 2 | Maths | \u2013 | Measurement: compare and sequence intervals of time. \nUK | KS2: Year 3 | Maths | - | Measurement: record and compare time in terms of hours, minutes, seconds; compare duration of tasks.

Credit: Mouser/Wikimedia  \n\n**What is a constellation? **\n\nConstellations are imaginary patterns that farmers, poets, navigators, or astronomers invented to easily identify stars. Stars are big balls of burning gases that emit light and heat. During the day, the light coming from our closest star, the Sun, is too strong to see the other stars. During the night, when it is very dark, we can see from 1000 to 1500 stars. It would be very hard to tell which star is which by looking just at one! Constellations, with their familiar shapes, help localise stars and allow us to find our way through the night sky. There are 88 constellations, adopted by the International Astronomical Union, across the sky between the northern and southern hemispheres so some constellations are only visible in one hemisphere. Stars belonging to a constellation are not on the same plane and can be at various distances from the Earth. Changing our position in the galaxy would change the relative positions of a group of stars, so we would see different constellations. \n\nSee how the night sky would appear from a different part of the galaxy: http://nautil.us/issue/19/illusions/a-quick-spin-around-the-big-dipper https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD-5ZOipE48 \n\n**Origin of the Constellations**\n\nEver since people first wandered the Earth, great significance has been given to the celestial objects  seen in the sky. Throughout human history and across many different cultures, names and mythical stories have been attributed to the star patterns in the night sky to more easily remember and recognize them, giving birth to what we know as constellations.   \n\nConstellations were used by people for many practical reasons. For example, in agriculture, constellations could help determine when the seasons were coming before the birth of calendars. Constellations also helped navigators and explorers to find their way across the planet. These activities fastened the discovery of new constellations. Nowadays, astronomers still use the names of constellations to explain where a celestial object can be found in the sky.   \n\nText adapted from the constellations page - International Astronomical Union,  http://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/ \n\n**Introduction to the constellation of Orion**\n\nOrion is a constellation that has the shape of a man and is made of 7 main stars. It has been observed and drawn since prehistoric times. The name \u2018Orion\u2019 derives from Greek mythology. Orion was a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter of ancient times. \n\n**How do astronomers calculate the distance to a star?** \n\nAstronomers developed two methods to determine the distance of a star. The first one, known as parallax, uses triangulation. Astronomers observe the position of a star on one day (position 1 in the drawing below) and again six months later (position 2 in the drawing below). They can see the angle formed with the star and the Sun. Knowing that the diameter of the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun is about 300 million kilometres, astronomers use trigonometry to calculate the distance. This technique works for stars within about 400 light years of Earth. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/ad24fd88-d825-42fe-9ae0-d0afb6298ead/astroedu1607-parallax.png) \n\nAnother method is related to the brightness of a star. Astronomers observe and determine the real colour spectrum of the star. They compare the real brightness of the star to the brightness seen on Earth. Using these two values, astronomers can deduce the distance of the star from Earth. \n", "fulldesc": "###Preparation \nFor the activity, move all the tables and chairs to the side of the classroom so that the students have plenty of room to act out a geometric shape. You could also use the gym or the playground. To make a constellation prepare containers for each pair of students, each containing glow-in-the-dark modelling clay, corrugated cardboard, 7 wooden skewers, 4 corks, a ruler, glue, scissors, and a waterproof marker. Cut the corks in half, ready for the students.  \n\n###Three-dimensional shapes\nOrganise the students into four groups of six students. Send each group to a different corner of the room. Each group chooses a geometrical shape to act out together. They hold hands and stand in a triangle, a square etc. Explain that they are not allowed to choose a circle.  \n\nEach group chooses one student to act as the coordinator. The other five students make the shape together. The coordinator in each group examines the shape from different sides. Does the shape look the same from all sides?   \n\nThe coordinators draw the side views of their shapes on paper. Students discuss the drawings in their group then with the class and teacher. What do they notice? Does the shape change if they look at it from a different side? Why? Ask the students if they think this is also true for constellations.  \n\nYou can ask students to explain why you told them not to choose a circle to test if they understand perspective.   \n\nIntroduce students to the Orion constellation. Show students the picture of Orion in a bright sky and the drawing showing how we represent the constellation from the Earth in two dimensions.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/ad24fd88-d825-42fe-9ae0-d0afb6298ead/astroedu1607-orion-image.jpg) \n\nDiscuss with the class the position of stars in the constellation. Do they think the stars are on the same plane? Imagine that we could travel to another planet far, far away, would we make the same drawing? What does a constellation look like when seen from different sides?  \n\nStudents make a constellation and demonstrate that what we see in the sky depends on our position.    \n\n###Make a constellation\nDivide the group into pairs and give each pair a container. Students complete Task 1 on the worksheet. Explain that they must not press too hard on the cardboard when drawing the lines. Provide assistance in step 8 by cutting out the circle in the cardboard. While you cut the cardboard shapes, students start step 10 of the worksheet by placing the stars on the cardboard. When Task 1 is finished, students look through the eyehole at the three-dimensional Orion constellation and they draw the constellation as they see it looking through the eyehole.  \n\nSee step 16 of Task 1 on the worksheet for tips for the students if they cannot see their constellation clearly.  \n\n###Not on one line \nIn Task 2 of the worksheet students compare their constellation with the picture of the constellation on a clear winter night sky. Do the students see Orion as shown in the drawing or the picture?  \n\nEncourage the students to look at their constellation from different sides and draw what they see. Ask them why the constellation looks different when seen from different sides. They should be able to explain that this is because the stars are not located on the same plane.  \n\nIf they could travel through space to another planet very far away from the Earth, with a different perspective on the constellation, could we see the same patterns at night?

It is a rather ordinary star, not particularly big or small, not particularly young or old. It is the source of heat that sustains life on Earth, and controls our climate and weather. It is the closest star to Earth, and the most closely studied. From it we have learned a great deal about the physical processes that determine the structure and evolution of stars in general. \n\n**Observing the Sun** \n\nLooking directly at the Sun, even for a brief moment, is a bad idea \u2014 our eyes are very sensitive to its light. Even in the dark, at least when there is only the tiniest amount of light, your eyes still manage to detect things. So imagine what happens when you focus all that bright light from the Sun on a tiny area like the eye. The light detectors at the back of the eye get burned. Unfortunately, unlike a sunburn on your skin, your eye probably won't recover and you could lose your sight. \n\nIf you would like a very visual demonstration of how damaging the Sun can be, have a look at Stuart Lowe's astronomy blog http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000347.shtml. He has made a video of what happens when a grape is put up to the eyepiece of a telescope that is pointed directly at the Sun, with no filters. Very quickly the grape begins to blacken and burn. The eye is much more delicate than a grape so the demonstration is quite a powerful reminder to be careful when looking at the Sun. So, please, no matter what, do not look directly at the Sun. \n\n**Sundial**\n\nDuring the daytime we notice that time passes by because of the Sun in the sky. Because the Earth completes a rotation on its axis in one day, the Sun appears to rise in the East at the beginning of the day, climb high at noon and then disappear into the horizon in the evening in the West. Babylonians observed this movement of the Sun and constructed the sundial, which was the first version of a Wall clock or a hand watch. Using sunlight and the sundial, the Babylonians divided the day into hours.  \n\nThe time on a sundial is shown by a shadow produced by a gnomon, and falling onto a surface called the dial face or dial plate. Due to our relative locations to the Sun, a sundial used in the northern hemisphere must be reversed to be used in the southern hemisphere.  \n\nDifferent types of sundial exists. The shadow can be cast on the ground, creating a horizontal sundial, or it can be cast on a wall, creating a vertical sundial. The lines showing the hours will be different depending on the latitude of the location. If you use a sundial at the north pole in summer, hourly marks would have a separation of 15 degrees. One day equals 24 hours, and one rotation divides into 360 degrees. Therefore, 1 hour on a sundial is represented by 15 degrees of rotation.  \n\nAn equatorial sundial has a dial plate parallel to the Earth's equator. The gnomon should be perpendicular to the dial plate so it is inclined at an angle equal to the latitude of the observer and points towards true north.  The hour lines are spaced at 15 degrees.  \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/49080aa5-1f83-4a8d-89ee-8b618e886767/astroedu1608-equatorial-sundial.jpg) \nImage: Equatorial Sundial example", "fulldesc": "###Preparation \nFor the activity \u2018The large sundial\u2019, you will need a playing field that is in sunlight most of the day. \n\n###What time is it?\nAsk if any of the students are wearing a watch. Why is it handy to have a watch? Explain that 600 years ago nobody had a watch. Ask how the people back then knew what time it was. Before the mechanical clock was invented, it was much more difficult to know the time of the day. People found out that they could use the Sun to tell the time. They did this using a sundial. \n\nTip. Long ago people also used other devices to tell the time, such as an hourglass.  \n\nHave any students ever seen a sundial? Do they know how it works? Explain that a sundial has a stick or pointer that makes a shadow. This is called the gnomon. It is important that in the Northern Hemisphere, the gnomon always points north, or you will not be able to read the sundial. Explain that the Earth turns on its axis. This means that the position of the Sun with regard to the Earth is always changing. If necessary demonstrate this using a torch and an orange or globe. Explain that the shadow of an object also changes as the Earth rotates. The sundial uses this fact. By looking at the position of the shadow of the gnomon on the sundial, you can tell what time it is. \n\nThe students make two sundials. \n\n*Good to know.* When the Sun is due south and the shadow is pointing to the north, it is noon. That means it is exactly 12 o\u2019clock in solar time. Solar time is not always exactly the same as the time shown on your watch. That is because the time we use today is not based on the Sun\u2019s actual position in the sky. \n\n###Make a sundial\n![](/media/activities/attach/49080aa5-1f83-4a8d-89ee-8b618e886767/astroedu1608-sundial-time.jpg)\n\nHand out scissors, glue, and the activity sheet.  \n\nThe students complete Task 1 on the worksheet. \n\nImportant: To calculate the angle for the gnomon, you need to know the latitude of your town. You can look this up in an atlas or on the internet. For example the latitude of London is 51 degrees N, so the angle needed for a sundial in London is 51 degrees. The instructions are on the worksheet. When the sundial is ready, the students should put it somewhere with the arrow facing south. \n\nThe students read the time shown by the sundial. Can they see what time it is? The students complete Task 1 on the worksheet. Discuss the tasks. Come to the conclusion that today we always know exactly what time it is because there are so many clocks around us. Long ago, when there weren't any watches and clocks, it was much more difficult to tell the time. And of course they could not use a sundial at night! \n\n*Good to know.* \nThis sundial is based on GMT+1. This may need adjusting depending on your local time. For example, in the UK, this would match British Summer Time, but for wintertime every hour number would need to be one hour earlier. So 12 would be 11, 1 would be 12, etc. If you are making it in Central European Summer Time (GMT+2), you will need to change the numbers. Every hour number will need to be one hour later. So will be 1, 1 will be 2, etc.  \n\n###The large sundial at least\nMake a large sundial with the students. Take the students outside to a location where the Sun shines most of the day. Mark the direction of north, using a compass if necessary. \n\nStand the large protractor upright on its long side in the grass. Use it to measure the correct angle to the ground, as described above. Stick the stick firmly in the ground at the chosen angle, facing north. See the picture for how this should be done. \n\nEvery hour the students place a large stone on the ground where the shadow of the stick falls. One of the students uses the marker pen to write the number of the hour on the stone. You can use the smaller stones to mark the quarter and half hours.  \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/49080aa5-1f83-4a8d-89ee-8b618e886767/astroedu1608-horizontal-sundial.jpg) \nImage: Horizontal Sundial \n\nIf you don't want to take the students outside every hour, you can just place two stone markers, one in the morning (for example at 9.00) and one in the afternoon (for example at 14.00). Of course your sundial will be less accurate. \n\nTo finish the sundial, the rest of the day after school-time needs to be divided using the stones. In the example shown below, five hours have passed and so the time in between needs to be divided into five. Encourage the students to write the numbers of the hours on the stones and place them in the correct position. The next day, take the students outside to see if they can read what time it is.  They compare the time they read on the sundial with the time shown by a watch.   \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/49080aa5-1f83-4a8d-89ee-8b618e886767/astroedu1608-sundial-drawing.jpg) \n\nHow accurate is their sundial?

On a map, it is common to indicate only the North direction. Cartographers defined the cardinal points and draw maps with the North at the top by convention. \n\nCardinal points provide a systematic way to tell someone where places are. In cultures that do not descend from European traditions, the cardinal directions could be shown with colours or numbers. \n\nThere are many ways to find the cardinal directions: some use the sun or stars, others the magnetic properties of the Earth (e.g., a compass). Today, satellite navigation (GPS) is widely used.  \n\n**Cartography**  \n\nCartography is the study and the creation of maps. Humans have been creating and using maps since early ages in its history but the oldest map that has survived over time is a map of the Babylonian city of Nippur. The technologies used to create maps have evolved a lot since their beginnings. \n\nMapping started with manual constructions and gradually used new techniques and tools like the compass, telescope, and sextant, increasing the accuracy of maps. In the 20th century, aerial photography and satellite imagery tremendously improved the mapping of physical elements such as buildings, roads, rivers, etc. More recently, GPS can perform direct mapping.   \n\n**Scales** \n\nA scale is a ratio that compares a measurement on a map (or figure) to the actual distance between locations identified on the map (or figure). It's the mathematical relationship between the length or figurative distance on the map and the actual length of the represented distance. Scales have no units. A scale is represented by an ordinary fraction (such as 1 / 1 000 000) or a mathematical ratio (1: 1 000 000). The number 1 means the unit on the map (1 cm) and number 1 000 000 the actual size (1 000 000 cm is about 10 km). \n\n**Maps** \n\nA map is a simplified representation of populated areas, geographical features, roads, rivers, continents, and oceans. In addition to maps of the Earth and its countries, a city plans or ordnance survey charts are also types of map. In the past, maps were drawn using a compass, an astrolabe, and a tape measure.  Nowadays, they are charted using aerial photography and GPS. \n\nMaps are used for several purposes. The world map shows us countries, large rivers and mountains, the position of oceans and deserts, etc. A country map shows us larger cities and towns, roads, etc. Ordnance survey maps show contours, roads, houses, forests, etc. A city plan shows us streets, monuments, parks, etc. All maps show the cardinal points as well as a scale. \n", "fulldesc": "![](/media/activities/attach/8dd884b9-3c59-42fb-8031-86e8db488c25/astroedu1610-world-map.jpg) \nA world map showing the continents and the sea beds in relief. The blue represents the sea. Dark blue represents the deeper ocean beds and light blue the shallower beds. The continents are shown in yellow and the darker areas are the contours. The positions of the Equator, the Greenwich meridian, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, the Arctic and the Antarctic Circles are shown on the map. \n\n###What do you see on a map?  \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/8dd884b9-3c59-42fb-8031-86e8db488c25/astroedu1610-azores.jpg) \nImage: Archipelago of the Azores. Credit: Varp/Wikimedia Commons  \n\n###Step 1:\nAsk students how we could find out where all the countries in the world are or how do we know the way if we want to travel somewhere new. We use a map: mobile applications and GPS are all based on this concept. \n\n###Step 2:\nAsk students to look at the map or the globe. Ask them to describe what they see and encourage them to explain what they think different colours represent on the map. \n\n###Step 3:\nDivide students into small groups. Distribute one map per group and several stickers or labels. Ask the group to write down \u201cmountain\u201d, \u201cocean\u201d, \u201c[your country]\u201d and to stick the label to the corresponding feature on the map.  \n\n###Step 4:\nAsk students if they see the differences in the colour blue. Ask them if they know what dark blue refers to. Explain that they show the mountains on the sea bed. As an example find the Azores archipelago and notice how they all form part of a chain which rises out of the sea bed and crosses the Earth from North to South.  \n\n###Cardinal points, latitude, and longitude\n\n###Step 1:\nFind the cardinal points on their world map. Explain that cardinal points are used to describe where a place is. \n\n###Step 2:\nUsing the stickers on the maps, ask the students to localise the different elements relative to each other using different cardinal points. E.g.: Atlantic Ocean is west of Europe? \n\n###Step 3:\nAsk students to consider how we might define a particular location on a map. What are the issues involved? The cardinal points help us to describe an object's location relative to another but to be more general and precise, we need a system of reference. We define a grid with grid lines at specific locations and their direction defined using the cardinal points. This allows us to define a location on Earth using longitude (giving the east to west position from the Prime Meridian) and latitude (giving the north to south position from the Equator).  \n\n###How to build a map? Aerial photography. \n![](/media/activities/attach/8dd884b9-3c59-42fb-8031-86e8db488c25/astroedu1610-lisbon.jpg) \nImage: An aerial photograph of Lisbon from Sentinel-1A\u2019s radar. Credit: Copernicus data/ESA (2014)\n\n###Step 1:\nDistribute the aerial photographs of your city. Ask students to recognize different elements in the photo like buildings, sea, rivers, etc. You can ask students if they can locate some known places on the map like your school. Identify the scale and relevant features.  \n\n###Step 2:\nDiscuss with students what the scale represents. Ask them to measure the distance between two objects on the map, either chosen by the educator or by free choice of the students. Students then use the scale to calculate the distance between the objects in real life. \n\n###Step 3:\nDistribute tracing paper to students and ask them to copy the picture. Students draw a map of this area and identify what they think are the relevant features. For example, rivers, bridges, roads, etc. Students lay out their own map.  \n\n###Step 4:\nExplain that this is how modern maps are made. Aerial photographs are taken with balloons, planes or other flying objects, and the different elements in the photos identified. \n\n###Step 5:\nYou can ask students if they know any other device that allows us to see aerial photographs. Ask students if they have seen a GPS. Explain that some objects fly even higher than airplanes around the Earth. These objects are called satellites; they are so high that they need to fly on a rocket to space. Satellites watch the Earth and send us very precise information about locations on the planet, an object's longitude and latitude.   \n", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section |\n-|-|-|-|-\nUK | KS2 | Geography | - | Locational knowledge: Identify the position and significance of latitude, longitude, Equator, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circle, the Prime/Greenwich Meridian and time zones (including day and night). \nUK | KS2 | Geography | - | Geographical skills and fieldwork: Use maps, atlases, globes and digital/computer mapping to locate countries and describe features studied Use the eight points of a compass, four and six-figure grid references, symbols and key (including the use of Ordnance Survey maps) to build knowledge of the United Kingdom and the wider world. \nUK | KS2: Year 6 | Maths | - | Ratio and proportion: Solve problems involving the relative sizes of two quantities where missing values can be found by using integer multiplication and division facts. \nWales | KS2 | Geography | - | Skills: Locating places, environments, and patterns.

This may be linked to talking about the importance of satellites and about its uses in our everyday life. \n\nLand and offshore surveying were some of the first sectors to exploit this new technology. Ordnance Survey uses GPS for the majority of its surveys to provide national mapping infrastructure.  \n\n**What is satellite navigation?** \nSource: http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/About_satellite_navigation2  \n\nSince the beginning of time, human beings have looked to the sky to determine their whereabouts. Traditionally, the Sun and the pattern of fixed stars have been their guides. But in the second millennium, constellations of man-made satellites have taken over as beacons to guide the way. \n\nUsing the \u2018fixed\u2019 stars, you can determine your position anywhere on the Earth\u2019s surface to within a few hundred metres, provided the weather is fine. But navigation satellites can tell you where you are to the nearest few metres or better, whatever the weather. Enhanced instruments can even pinpoint the position of a stationary object to within a few centimetres by measuring the object\u2019s position many thousands of times over several hours and then working out the average of the measurements. The European Space Agency's (ESA\u2019s) Galileo mission is a new generation of European navigation satellites, launching in 2016.  \n", "conclusion": "In this activity, students familiarise themselves with the concept of a map.

The Milky Way is a fairly large spiral galaxy and it has three main components: a disk, in which the solar system resides, a central bulge at the core, and an all-encompassing halo. \n\nThe disk of the Milky Way has four spiral arms and it is approximately 300 parsecs thick (1 parsec is approximately 3.26 light-years) and 30,000 parsecs in diameter. Compare this to the four hours it takes light to travel from the Sun to Neptune! Our galaxy is made up predominantly of Population I stars, which tend to be blue and are reasonably young, spanning a million and ten billion years in age. \n\n**Light-year:**\n\nA light-year is how astronomers measure astronomical distances and it is equivalent to the distance that light travels in one year, nearly 9.46 trillion kilometres. \n\nThe bulge at the centre of the galaxy is a flattened ellipse of dimensions 1000 parsecs by 6000 parsecs. This is a high-density region where Population II stars predominate---stars that tend toward red and are very old: about 10 billion years. There is growing evidence for a very massive black hole at its centre. \n\n** Black holes:**\n\nBlack holes are the monsters of space! Anything that gets too close to a Black Hole is pulled to it with such a strong force that it has no chance of escape. Even light \u2013 the fastest thing in the Universe \u2013 is doomed if it goes near one of these monsters. This is why black holes are black. However, they are not really holes and they are not empty. Black Holes are actually filled with a lot of material that is crammed into an extremely small region.  \n\nThe halo, a diffused spherical region, surrounds the disk. It has a low density of old stars mainly in globular clusters (consisting of between 10,000 and 1,000,000 stars). The halo is believed to be composed mostly of dark matter, which may extend well beyond the edge of the disk.  \n\n**Dark matter:**\n\nAccording to scientists roughly 80 per cent of the mass of the universe is made up of material that they cannot observe directly. This material, known as dark matter, does not emit light or energy.    \n\n**Classification of Galaxies:** \n \nThere are two main categories of galaxies, the spiral and elliptical, and two others lenticular and irregular.  \n\nOur galaxy belongs to the spiral category. Spiral galaxies fall into several classes depending on their shape and the relative size of the bulge: ordinary spirals are labelled either Sa, b, c, d, or m while those that have developed a bar in the interior region of the spiral arms are labelled SBa, b, c, d, or m. Spiral galaxies are characterised by the presence of gas in the disk, which implies that star formation is active at the present time, hence the younger population of stars. Spirals are usually found in a low-density galactic field where their delicate shape can avoid disruption by tidal forces from neighbouring galaxies.  \n\n**Tidal forces:**\n\nThese forces are a secondary effect of the gravitational forces between two objects orbiting each other, such as the Earth and the Moon. Tidal forces are responsible for the fluctuation of the tides as well as for the synchronous rotation of certain moons as they orbit their planets.   \n\nElliptical galaxies are placed in categories E0-7 depending on their degree of ellipticity, with E0 being least elliptical. They have a uniform luminosity and are similar to the bulge in a spiral galaxy, but with no disk. The stars are old and there is no gas present. Ellipticals are usually found in a high-density field, at the centre of clusters.  \n\nLenticulars are labelled S0 and, although they possess both a bulge and a disk, they have no spiral arms. There is little or no gas and so all the stars are old. They appear to be an intermediate.  \n\nIrregulars are small galaxies, labelled Irr, with no bulge and an ill-defined shape.", "fulldesc": "*Tip.* You can see the Milky Way with the naked eye. You can see it best in January when the Moon is new. Encourage the students to look for this if possible. \n\n###Preparation \nFor the activity Further and further away you will need to find the film Powers of Ten on the \ninternet. Watch this film and pay attention so that you know precisely when each question is discussed. Prepare to show the film to the class. \n\n###Activity 1: Further and further away\n\n\n###Step 1:\nRead the e-mail in Task 1 of the worksheet with the students. The students need to find answers to the following questions from the researchers: \n\n1. What does the Milky Way look like? \n2. Whereabouts in the Milky Way is our Solar System?   \n3. Why can't we see the whole Milky Way from Earth?  \n4. Is Earth large or small compared with the universe? \n5. Is the Milky Way large or small compared with the universe?  \n6. What is the Milky Way made of? \n\n###Step 2:\nWatch the film Powers of Ten with the students in order to find the answers to the researchers' questions. This film shows a journey from a picnic in a grassy meadow in America to a location far beyond the Milky Way. Halfway through the film the journey returns to the grassy meadow and into the hand of one of the picnickers. You are recommended to play the film until the journey returns to the picnic field so that the students get a good impression of the immense size of the universe, and just how tiny the Earth is in comparison.\n\n###Step 3:\nStart by watching the whole film with the students. Explain what they are seeing. Then watch the film again, but this time pause it where relevant to give the students the opportunity to answer the research questions. After they have seen the film, the students will be able to answer questions a to e. Once they have completed the Make a Milky Way craft project, the students can answer the final question. \n\n###Step 4:\nThe students investigate what the Milky Way looks like and the position of the Solar System within it.  \n\n###Activity 2: Make a Milky Way\nNow the students have some idea of what the Milky Way looks like, they are going to make a model of it. The students complete Task 2 on the worksheet. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/9321b1c0-dae7-4cc0-8e2f-464539461881/astroedu1611-milkyway-model.png) \n\n###Activity 3: What do you know about the Milky Way?  \nThe students read the instructions in Task 3 and write all the answers to the research questions in the e-mail in Task 1. If necessary, watch the film Powers of Ten one more time. Discuss the answers in the e-mail.  \n1. If we could view the Milky Way from the side, it would look like a saucer with a bulge in the middle. \n2. The Earth's solar system is situated on a spiral arm about two-thirds of the way from the centre of the Milky Way. \n3. We don't have any telescopes that can reach far enough out from the Milky Way to take a good photograph of it as a whole. The existing pictures of the Milky Way look like real photographs, but are in fact an artist's impression of what we think it looks like. Explain that it is possible to see part of the Milky Way disc at night when the sky is dark. It is easy to photograph the Milky Way disc from Earth, because this is the part we can see. \n4. The most important aspect of this question is that the students see that our Solar System is only a tiny part of the Milky Way. \n5. Here again, the Milky Way is only a tiny part of a much larger universe.   \n6. The Milky Way is a galaxy made up of dust, gas, and at least 200 billion stars, most of which can be found in the disc. The system contains old stars, younger stars, dust, and gas clouds. It is composed of a central bulge and a disc with four large and several smaller spiral arms.  \n\n*Good to know:*\nIt takes 8 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Earth. It takes much longer for light from the other stars to reach Earth. So when we look at the universe we are really looking into the past. The mass of the universe is estimated to be 100 billion times greater than the mass of the Sun. \n\n###Activity 4: The name Milky Way\nAsk the students if they know where the name Milky Way comes from.   \n\nEgyptian mythology describes the Milky Way as being formed by the milk from a celestial cow. The four feet of the cow were supported by the four corners of the Earth. Greek mythology tells the story that Hera, the wife of Zeus had been given the baby Heracles to breastfeed. When she realised he was not her own child, she pushed him away. The milk that was spilled became the Milky Way. \n\nIt is important that the students realise that long ago people had no idea what the Milky Way really was.

This distance is such that the average surface temperature is above the freezing point of water (0\u00b0C) and liquid water can exist freely. This has played a fundamental role in the development of life on our planet, unlike on Venus and Mars, whose surface temperatures are either much warmer or much colder. Earth only has one natural satellite, the Moon, which is thought to have played a major role in stabilising the axis of rotation of the Earth. Once again, this may have been a favourable element in the emergence of life. \n\nOne billion years after the Sun and Earth formed, the first known life on Earth, single-celled organisms such as bacteria, emerged around 3.8 billion years ago. One billion years later, multicellular life appeared, though not in forms we would recognise today. Insects and then fish began to evolve around 500 million years ago, and dinosaurs and then mammals around 200 million years ago. 65 million years ago, the extinction of the dinosaurs occurred, and the number of mammals increased. By comparison humans (Homo sapiens) are very recent, emerging only 200,000 years ago. \n\n**Universe**\n\nThe universe is the vast expanse of space which contains all of the matter and energy in existence. \n\nThe universe contains all the galaxies, stars, and planets. The exact size of the universe is unknown. Scientists postulate that the universe is still expanding outward: the result of a violent, powerful explosion that occurred about 13.7 billion years ago. This explosion is known as the Big Bang. By looking at the change in colour of light (its electromagnetic spectrum) from an object, scientists can determine if an object is moving away from or towards Earth.  If the colour of light from an object is shifted towards red, it is moving away from us. The more redshifted the light, the faster it is moving away from us. All of the distant galaxies have tremendous redshifts. Based on these data, scientists postulate that the universe is still expanding outward.      \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/68fc8d48-daa2-4825-ae23-ab5f4af78a96/astroedu1612-hubble-deep-field-image.jpg) \nImage: NASA ESA STScI (S.

After this, the universe developed, the galaxies (including our own, the Milky Way) were formed, the Sun was born, and the Earth took shape. The various geological eras passed, and life as we know it today evolved from the first living organisms. On the timeline the students will be making, the Big Bang took place at 00.00 on 1 January.

Stars emit light and heat and appear in the night sky as a multitude of luminous points. The closest star to the Earth is the Sun. If the distance between the Earth and the Sun was 1 meter, the next nearest star (Proxima Centauri) would be at 260,000 km away from us!  \n\n**Why do we see stars better during the night? **\n\nStars are always in the sky, both during night and day. But when it is day, the Sun, our own star lights up the sky and makes it so bright that we cannot see other stars, which are further away. On the other hand, when it is night, the sky gets dark and the light of stars further away becomes visible. To demonstrate this to students, you can use an activity about day and night.  \n\n**Origin of the Constellations **\n\nEver since people first wandered the Earth, great significance has been given to celestial objects seen in the sky. Throughout human history and across many different cultures, names and mythical stories have been attributed to the star patterns in the night sky to remember and recognise them easier, thus giving birth to what we know as constellations. \n\nWhen were the first constellations recorded? Archaeological studies have identified possible paintings representing constellations, for example, on the walls in a cave system at Lascaux in southern France made almost 17,300 years ago. The ancient Greeks were the first to describe over half of the 88 constellations recognised by the International Astronomical Union today. Between the 16th and 17th century AD, European astronomers and celestial cartographers added new constellations to the 48 previously described by Ptolemy; these new constellations were mainly \u2018new discoveries\u2019 made by the Europeans who first explored the Southern Hemisphere. \n\nPeople used constellations for many different reasons. This fastened the discovery of new constellations. The first uses were probably religious but constellations had mainly practical uses. For example, in agriculture, constellations could help determine when the seasons were coming before using calendars. Constellations also helped navigators and explorers to find their way across the planet. Nowadays, astronomers still use the names of constellations to identify where a celestial object can be seen in the sky.  \n\n**Constellation Figures** \n\nIn star maps, it is common to mark \u2018line patterns\u2019 of the shape that makes a constellation. Famous ones include Orion and Ursa Major (illustrated below). However, the IAU defines a constellation by its boundary (indicated by sky coordinates) and not by its pattern and the same constellation may have several variants in its representation. \n\nThe constellations should be differentiated from asterisms. Asterisms are patterns or shapes of stars that are not related to the known constellations, but nonetheless are widely recognised by laypeople or in the amateur astronomy community. Examples of asterisms include the seven bright stars in Ursa Major known as \u2018the Plough\u2019 in Europe or \u2018the Big Dipper\u2019 in the United States of America.   \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e66b6ccd-3008-4a31-8466-d776735359d9/astroedu1613-big-dipper-compare.jpg) \nThe big dipper is part of the Ursa Major constellations illustrated.  \n\nText adapted from the constellations page - International Astronomical Union, http://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/  \n", "fulldesc": "###Preparation \nFor the activity \u2018Make a Star Lantern\u2019, copy the constellations from the worksheet onto various colours of A3 card.

Credit: NASA, ESA, Z. Levay (STScI) and A. Fujii\n\n###Activity 1: What constellations do you recognise? \n\n###Step 1:\nSit in a circle with the students. Ask the students if they know what stars are. \n\n###Step 2:\nExplain that you can see the stars best at night. Stars give light but during the day, the Sun, our star, gives so much light that we cannot see the others.  \n\n###Step 3:\nPlace the drawings of the constellations on the worksheet in the middle of the circle. From top to bottom the constellations shown are: Leo (lion), Pisces (a pair of fish), and Scorpio (scorpion). \n\n###Step 4:\nEncourage the students to describe what figures they can see in the stars. Explain that we call these figures constellations.\n\n###Step 5:\nLook at each constellation and describe what it is supposed to look like and what it is called. Explain that long ago, people thought this was what the constellations looked like if you joined up the stars.\n\n###Activity 2: Make a star lantern\n\n###Step 1:\nGive each child a sheet of A3 card with a copied constellation, an embroidery needle and a thick layer of newspaper.\n\n###Step 2:\nAsk the students to prick holes in the points of the star sign, using the layers of newspaper as a pad under the card. Encourage them to prick big holes, or the light won't shine through them clearly.\n\n###Step 3:\nRoll the card to form a cylinder and staple the edges together.\n\n###Step 4:\nMake two holes at the top and tie a piece of string across.\n\n###Step 5:\nHang the lantern on the stick and use a piece of string to hang the lamp inside the lantern. The lanterns are ready. \n\n*Tip:* Encourage the children to make small balls of crepe paper. They can paste these onto their lantern, but make sure they don\u2019t cover the holes. When the children have finished decorating the card, put the lanterns aside to dry. You can paste coloured tissue paper on the inside of the lantern for a nice effect.  \n\n###Activity 3: Let the stars shine\n\n###Step 1:\nTurn off the lights and/or close the blinds in the classroom.\n\n###Step 2:\nAsk the students to switch on their lantern lights.\n\n###Step 3:\nAsk them what they can see on their lantern.\n\n###Step 4:\nExplain that the spots of light on their lantern form a constellation. The lights are the stars.\n\n*Optional:* Take and print a photograph of each child with their lantern. Can you recognise the constellations on the photographs? Compare the constellation with a real picture of the sky.   \n\nYou can show pictures of other famous and bright constellations.   \n\n###Step 5:\nExplain that we cannot always see the same constellations; some are not visible during the whole year. This is because the Earth is spinning and moving around the Sun. This gives us the impression that the stars are moving.   \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e66b6ccd-3008-4a31-8466-d776735359d9/astroedu1613-zodiac.jpg) \nImage: Illustration of the \u2018zodiac band\u2019 with a few of the constellations depicting the objects they represent. Credit: LPI USRA\n\n###Design your own constellation\n\n###Step 1:\nThe students use luminous paint to paint their own constellation on paper or on a sky map. They can make it any shape they like. They can use existing stars on the sky map or draw their own on white paper.\n\n###Step 2:\nExplain that they can paint spots (to represent the individual stars), or they can choose to make a drawing of the constellation using the luminous paint. Let the paintings dry on the windowsill or near the radiators.\n\n###Step 3:\nOnce the paintings are dry, make it dark in the classroom. Encourage the students to show their constellations, give them a name, and say what they represent.   \n\n###Step 4:\nShow a picture of the night sky at the end of the activity, ask students if they recognise or find a constellation.\n\n###Step 5:\nEncourage the students to look at the real night sky at night and find constellations.   \n\n*Safety note:* this activity uses embroidery needles for building the lanterns and requires supervision. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/e66b6ccd-3008-4a31-8466-d776735359d9/astroedu1613-constellations.jpg) ", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n-|-|-|-|-\nUK | KS1 | Art and Design | - | To use drawing, painting, and sculpture to develop and share their ideas, experiences, and imagination. \n", "additional_information": "To check if the constellations discussed during the activity are visible in the sky at the time of the activity, you can download free software like Stellarium, http://stellarium.org/.

It is luminous and extremely hot. Even though the Earth is about 150 million kilometres away from the Sun, we still feel the energy from the explosions that happen within it. Humans and many other creatures on Earth depends on the heat and light coming from the Sun.\n\nSome stars in the universe are bigger and brighter than the Sun, but all other stars are very far away so appear as small points of light. For the part of the Earth that it is day time, the stars are hidden by the brightness of the Sun in the sky, as they are much fainter. When it is night time, with the Sun shining on the other side of the Earth, the stars can be seen in the dark sky.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/47f13be2-e593-4f85-8e90-da46f770a287/astroedu1614-sun-earth.jpg) \nImage credit: NASA/SDO/Steele Hill\n\n**Earth**\n\nA planet is an object orbiting a star which is spherical and bigger than an asteroid but smaller than a star. They can be rocky, like Earth, or gassy, like Jupiter. Earth is our home and the third planet from the Sun, with a mean distance of about 150 million kilometres. This distance and the atmosphere of Earth keep its average surface temperature above the freezing point of water (0\u00b0C) but below the boiling point of water (100\u00b0C), enabling liquid water to exist freely, giving us seas and oceans. This is not the case on Venus, where it is closer to the Sun and hotter than the boiling point of water, or Mars, where it is further away from the Sun and colder than the freezing point of water. Liquid water has been crucial for the development of life on our planet, the only known place where life exists in the universe.\n\nThe shape of the Earth is very close to a sphere. It spins, or rotates, once every 24 hours giving us the length of a day Earth only has one natural satellite, the Moon, which is thought to have played a major role in stabilising the axis of rotation of the Earth. This may have also been a favourable condition for the emergence of life.\n\n**Moon**\n\nSatellites, including moons, orbit planets. The Moon is a natural satellite of Earth. It takes close to one month (27 days 8 hours) to revolve around our home planet. The Moon and Earth are about the same distance from the Sun. Despite this, the temperatures on the Moon are extreme, reaching higher and lower temperatures than on Earth, because the Moon lacks a rich atmosphere.\n\n**Solar System**\n\nA solar system refers to a star and all the objects that orbit it. Our Solar System consists of the Sun \u2014 our home star \u2014, eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon), dwarf planets, asteroids and comets.

Explain how the matching game works: in groups of three, students match the picture cards with the cards that have the matching texts. The game finishes when all the card pairs have been found.\n\nStep 2:\nBefore starting the game, encourage the students to lay out all the cards and look at all of the images and texts on the cards.\n\nStep 3:\nAfterwards, show students the correct pairing of the cards (use the answer sheet of the game). Then, discuss what the students learnt about the properties of Sun, Earth and Moon covering the following points:\n- It is much hotter on the Sun than on Earth, because the Sun is a star.\n- Stars are much hotter and brighter than planets. \n- The temperature on Earth is hotter than the temperature water freezes, but colder than the temperature water boils, giving us liquid water, and therefore oceans, on Earth. \n- The temperature on the Moon can range from very cold to very hot. \n- The Sun is more than a hundred times wider than the Earth. \n- The Earth is about four times wider than the Moon. \n\n###Activity 3: The revolving Earth\n\nStep 1:\nDraw a picture of the Earth in the middle of the board.

Together with hundreds of thousands of asteroids (boulders from the size of small pebbles to the size of a dwarf planet) and comets, these celestial bodies orbit the Sun.\n\nThe Earth is a very special planet among these celestial bodies. It is our home! In order to understand its uniqueness, students need to compare the Earth to the other planets in the Solar System. The Earth is located about 150 million kilometres from the Sun, giving a temperature that is exactly right for liquid water to be present on the surface, unlike on other planets. This proved crucial for the development of life!\n\nThe Solar System as a whole is part of the Milky Way galaxy, a collection of about 200 billion stars that are arranged in a spiral, along with gas and dust. Billions of these stars have planets and these, in turn, have moons. This suggests that we are probably not alone in the Milky Way, but the distances between the stars are so big that a visit to another world would be very difficult.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-solar-system.jpg) \nCredit: Wikimedia Common / Nick Risinger / NASA / JPL\n\nEven the star nearest to us, Proxima Centauri, is 4.22 light years (i.e., over 40 trillion kilometres) away from us. This is so distant that a journey there would take generations of human lives.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-solar-system-sketch.jpg) \nCredit: UNAWE / C.Provot\n\nPlanets that orbit stars other than our Sun are called extrasolar planets or exoplanets for short. Astronomers have already discovered more than 2000 of these exoplanets and regularly discover more. We can categorise the planets of our Solar System into two types: rocky planets, which are nearest to the Sun and have a solid surface, and gas giants, which are farther from the Sun and are more massive and mainly composed of gas. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars appear in the former category, and Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune make up the latter. Pluto, our formerly outermost planet, has been considered a dwarf planets since 2006. Between Mars and Jupiter is a so-called asteroid belt, which circles the Sun like a ring. It consists of thousands of smaller and larger boulders. The largest of these have their own names, just like the planets. One of them, Ceres, is so large that it is considered a dwarf planet.\n\n**The Planets**\n\nPlanets are spherical bodies orbiting a star. They have sufficient mass to have purged their orbits of all larger and smaller boulders thanks to their gravitational pull. Dwarf planets are also spherical and orbit a star, but they have small masses and therefore such weak gravity that they are not capable of attracting smaller boulders in their vicinity. Currently (in 2016) five dwarf planets have been identified: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris. Moons are often spherical as well, depending on their size, but they orbit planets.\n\nEach of the planets in our Solar System has very specific features. We have summarised them in the fact files below. The following rule of thumb is valid in the Solar System: small planets lie close to the Sun and are made of solid material, while large planets are farther away from the Sun and are mainly composed of gas. This is not necessarily true for planets around other stars, some of which have planets like Jupiter much closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun in our Solar System.\n\n**Rocky Planets**\n\nThe four rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) are very dense (solid) and comparatively small. Their atmospheres are very thin or non-existent (Mercury), with the exception of that of Venus.\n\n**Mercury**\n\nMercury is the planet nearest to the Sun. It has no atmosphere and its solid surface, like that of our Moon, is covered with many craters. Mercury orbits the Sun once in just 88 days and has no moons. There are severe temperature differences on its surface: 380\u00b0 C on the side facing the Sun, and -180\u00b0 C on the night side! This is because day and night shift very slowly on Mercury, because of its slow spin. Also, there is no atmosphere to trap the heat at night.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-mercury.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Venus**\n\nVenus is about as large as the Earth. Carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) makes up 99% of its atmosphere, which causes sunlight to get trapped in this mega greenhouse. Whether it is day or night, it is always very hot on Venus: almost 500\u00b0 C! While the other Solar System planets rotate in the same direction, anticlockwise, Venus rotates backwards, clockwise.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-venus.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Earth**\n\nEarth is the only planet in the Solar System that has liquid water on its surface, significant amounts of oxygen in the air and moderate temperatures. It orbits the Sun once a year. Its stable axis (inclined 23 degrees) results in seasons. Furthermore, it is the only celestial body on which we have found life so far.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-earth.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Mars**\n\nMars is half the size of the Earth. Its reddish colour is caused by iron oxide (rust). It has a very thin atmosphere, which mainly consists of carbon dioxide. One of its special features is its many extinct volcanoes, which reach heights of up to 22,000 metres! Mars has two very small moons and needs about twice as much time as the Earth to orbit the Sun. Like Earth, it also has seasons, as its rotation axis is inclined.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-mars.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Gas Giants**\n\nThe \u2018gas giants\u2019 are so-called because they are large compared to other planets and they are composed mostly of gas. They consist of a mighty atmosphere and a relatively small solid core.\n\n**Jupiter**\n\nJupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System. Like all giant planets, it mainly consists of gas and has a small solid core and a thin ring system. It has a remarkable red spot on its surface that is twice the size of the Earth! This spot is a huge storm (a cyclone) that has been raging for more than 400 years. It has at least 67 moons (in 2016) and is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-jupiter.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Saturn**\n\nSaturn is surrounded by large rings and therefore earns its nickname \u2018Lord of the rings\u2019. These rings consist of numerous small ice grains. Saturn\u2019s atmosphere has a fairly low density: Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System that could float on water. It has many moons: more than 60 (62 in 2016) and other unnamed \u2018moonlets\u2019.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-saturn.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Uranus**\n\nUranus has a few thin rings. Its surface looks very smooth and barely shows any structure. It has 27 known moons (2016).\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-uranus.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Neptune**\n\nNeptune\u2019s surface has a blue colour, like that of Uranus. White clouds fly over its surface at speeds of over 1000 km/hr. Neptune\u2019s path sometimes crosses the orbit of dwarf planet Pluto. The planet has a thin ring system and 14 known moons (2016).\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d96c3240-fec3-4044-88cf-3d17a0026096/astroedu1615-neptune.jpg) \nCredit: NASA\n\n**Dwarf Planet: Pluto**\n\nPluto is composed of ice and rock. In 2006, astronomers decided that Pluto should no longer be classed as a planet but only a dwarf planet, although it is spherical. Due to its low mass, it cannot attract smaller boulders in its vicinity, as the \u2018real\u2019 planets do. Pluto has one larger and two smaller moons. Currently, in 2016, there are 4 other planets considered as dwarf planets that could be added to the game on an equal standing with Pluto: Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.\n\n**Our knowledge of the Solar System**\n\nAstronomy research and tools evolve and improve very quickly. Our knowledge about space including our Solar System is extensive but not complete and it is constantly growing. Therefore, data given in the present resource might become incomplete or inaccurate over time. This might be illustrated with Pluto, considered for many years as the ninth planet of the Solar System and today identified as a dwarf planet.", "fulldesc": "###Preparation\n- Print out the card game PDF, one set per group.

Show students the correct order at the end. \n\n###Step 2: Colouring planets\nNext, the students colour the pictures of the card game. Ask each student to pick one card and colour it. Which peculiarities have to be taken into account?\n\n###Step 3: Playing the card game\n- On the back of each card, there is a summary of the most important features of the individual planets and the Sun. At the bottom, there is a question, whose answer indicates another celestial body in the Solar System. \n- Shuffle the cards and hand every student one card. \n- Ask the students to read and understand the exact properties of \u2018their\u2019 celestial body. \n- The student with the Sun card reads out loud the question on the bottom of the back of its card.

For example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the Sun. Likewise, the Moon is a satellite because it orbits Earth.\n\nThe Earth and Moon are examples of natural satellites. In astronomy, the word \u2018satellite\u2019 usually refers to a machine launched into space to orbit the Earth or another space object. Thousands of artificial satellites orbit Earth. Some take pictures of Earth to help meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes, while others take pictures of other planets, the Sun, black holes or faraway galaxies. These pictures help scientists better understand our Solar System and universe.\n\nMost satellites orbiting Earth, however, are used for communication, such as beaming TV signals and phone calls around the world. The Global Positioning System (GPS), a key navigation tool, is a group of more than 20 satellites. If you have a GPS receiver, these satellites can determine your exact location. \n\n**Why Are Satellites Important?** \n\nSatellites can see large areas of Earth at a time. This enables them to collect more data quicker than instruments on the ground. \n\nSatellites also can see into space better than telescopes on Earth's surface. This is because they fly above the clouds, dust and molecules in the atmosphere, which block certain wavelengths of light from reaching the ground. \n\nTV signals didn't go very far before the advent of satellites. They travel in relatively straight lines and quickly trail off into space rather than following Earth's curve. Sometimes mountains or tall buildings would block them. Making phone calls to faraway places were also a problem. Setting up telephone wires over long distances or underwater is difficult and expensive. \n\nWith satellites, TV signals and phone calls can be sent up toward a satellite and almost instantly bounced back to different locations on Earth. \n\n**What Are the Parts of a Satellite?** \n\nSatellites come in many shapes and sizes. Most have at least two parts in common, an antenna and a power source. The antenna sends and receives information, often to and from Earth. The power source can be a solar panel or battery. Solar panels make power by turning sunlight into electricity. \n\nMany satellites carry cameras and scientific sensors. Sometimes these instruments point toward Earth to gather information about our land, air and water. At other times, they face towards space to collect data from our Solar System and universe beyond. \n\n**How Do Satellites Orbit Earth?** \n\nMost satellites are launched into space on rockets. A satellite orbits Earth when its speed is balanced by the pull of Earth's gravity. Without this balance, the satellite would fly in a relatively straight line off into space or fall back to Earth. Satellites orbit Earth at different heights, different speeds and along different paths. The two most common types of orbit are \u2018geostationary\u2019 (jee-oh-STAY-shun-air-ee) and \u2018polar\u2019. \n\nA geostationary satellite travels from west to east over the equator. It moves in the same direction and at the same rate as Earth\u2019s spin. From Earth, a geostationary satellite looks like it is standing still since it is always above the same location. \n\nPolar-orbiting satellites travel in a north-south direction, from pole to pole. As Earth spins underneath, these satellites can scan the entire globe, one strip at a time. \n\n**Why Don't Satellites Crash Into Each Other?**\n\nActually, they can. NASA and other international organizations keep track of satellites in space. Collisions are rare because when a satellite is launched, it is placed into an orbit designed to avoid other satellites. But orbits can change over time. And the chances of a crash increase as more and more satellites are launched into space. \n\nIn February 2009, two communications satellites - one American and one Russian - collided in space. This, however, is believed to be the first time two artificial satellites have collided accidentally. ", "fulldesc": "Billions of people around the globe watch television, surf the internet, use phones, and use maps or navigation systems. Satellites are often involved in all these cases and play an important role in daily life. At the end of the lesson, the students will know what artificial satellites are, how they look, about their orbits, their functions, and how many there are. At the end of the activity, the students will make a satellite and explain the function of their satellite.\n\n###Step 1:\n\nShow the video \u2018What are Satellites?\u2019 http://youtu.be/lUaxDI9CSB0 and discuss why they are important, how do they orbit Earth, why don\u2019t they crash into each other, etc. Please refer to the background information. Following the discussion, show the video \u2018How Do Satellites Work\u2019 http://youtu.be/54MSV2B399o\n\nNOTE: If you don\u2019t have access to the videos, you can start the activity by discussing the topics from the background information. \n\n###Step 2: \nEncourage students to ask their own questions about satellites, and share them with the class. The questions don't necessarily need to be answered. The teacher could explain that a way to help investigate the answers to such questions is to build a model. \n\n###Step 3: \nDiscuss the basics parts of a satellite and show the video \u2018Parts of a Satellite\u2019 http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Satellites/Sci-Media/Video/Parts-of-a-satellite Highlight the most important parts: \n* Antennas and transceivers: to send and receive radio signals to and from the Earth or another satellite \n* Rocket motors: to move the satellite in space, to put it into orbit or course correction; \n* Fuel tanks: to store fuel for the rocket \n* Solar panels: to generate electricity \n* Batteries: to store the electricity generated \n* On-board processors: to provide processing capabilities to the satellite \n\n###Step 4: \nShow the following examples of satellites: \n* Telecommunications, Artemis: An artist's impression of Artemis. Carrying three payloads plus a number of experiments, ARTEMIS (Advanced Relay and Technology Mission Satellite) tests and operates new telecommunications techniques.\n* Research, Hubble space telescope: This illustration shows the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope in its high orbit, 600 kilometres above Earth.\n* Weather satellite, Metop: MetOp is a series of three polar orbiting meteorological satellites operated by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)\n* Navigation satellite, GPS: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based navigation system that provides location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The system provides critical capabilities to military, civil and commercial users around the world. The United States government created the system, maintains it, and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver. \n\n###Step 5: \nProvide each student (or a group) with materials to build an artificial satellite. Encourage students to be creative. Explain that students need to decide the satellite function, how a satellite would need to look or be constructed, and what type of orbit it would need to serve its function.\n\n###Step 6: \nWhen students are finished building their satellites, ask them to present it to the class explaining its components, functions, and use. Encourage classroom discussion by asking questions. \n\nSuggested teacher questions to spark discussion: \n* Why is it useful to build models? \n* What are the strengths and limitations of this model satellite? \n* What aspects of a satellite does the model represent well, and what can be improved? \n* What can we learn from this model? \n* How could we improve the model? \n* How is it important to the society?", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section\n-|-|-|-|- \nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Science | - | Earth and Space: the idea of the Earth's rotation.\nUK | KS2: Year 4 | Science | - | Electricity: identify common appliances that run on electricity.\n", "additional_information": "What Is a Satellite? http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-satellite-58.html \n\nSatellite Facts for Kids: http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/space/satellites.html ", "conclusion": "By building a satellite using household materials, students learn about artificial satellites, their functions and importance to society.

For centuries, the stars in the night sky served as inspiration to people all over the world. Stars have been featured not only in scientific study, but also in cultural stories and art. Astronomers have observed stars for centuries, first with naked eyes, later with telescopes from the ground and then from space. Little by little they have understood what a star is.\n\nIn art, stars are usually represented as pointed objects with five (or more) points. This is because the light from stars passes through the Earth's atmosphere through moving pockets of hot and cold air, causing stars to twinkle and look pointy. We see stars as very small as they are very far away. They look so small in fact they are just a small tiny dot of light. When our telescopes see these stars, the light gets bent inside around the rods which hold the mirrors in the telescope, giving a star four points. A similar thing happens in the eye due to structures inside it. This does not happen when we look at planets in our solar system because they look bigger so are disc shaped rather than a point of light. Up close, stars do not have any points. They are large spheres of very hot gas, like the Sun. The Sun is the star closest to our planet.\n\nThere are different types of stars. Our Sun is a yellow dwarf star. Stars have different colours and are classified as red, yellow, or blue. Red stars are the colder ones, while blue stars are the hottest, just like the different colours of the flame on a gas stove. Apart from yellow dwarves, there are many other types of stars, such as red giant. The red giant, or supergiant star, is bigger and cooler. When stars like our sun, run out of fuel (i.e. it runs out of hydrogen atoms to convert to helium atoms), the star expands to its red giant phase.\n\nWe have also heard of shooting stars. These are not actual stars but are meteorites: small pieces of rock flying through space that burn as they travel through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.

The wonderful thing about improvisation is that it is creative and open ended. When improvising, there are no mistakes. Engaging students in musical improvisation is a great way of building confidence and encouraging creative risk taking. \n\nIn this activity, students create brief (15-30 second) musical improvisations in response to astronomical images. They then describe how the music they created connects with the image. Students thus explore ways of using sound to depict what they see. \n\nThis activity is designed for use by both music and science educators. Improvisation is an important skill for students to develop in the music classroom. Many musical traditions incorporate improvisation, most notably jazz. Music curriculum guidelines from various countries emphasize that students should not only perform music composed by others, but also create their own music. This activity provides a way of building confidence by giving students an opportunity to improvise in a free-form manner in which it is almost impossible to fail. Science and music teachers may wish to collaborate in leading this activity.\n \nThe activity is designed to be adaptable to the resources at hand.

The activity can also be done with instruments that are available locally in a school or community. If you have only one or two instruments available, they can be passed around the class as students take turns. \n\nFor students that have little or no musical background, percussion instruments (drums, shakers, etc.) are best. Anything that makes sound will work.", "fulldesc": "![](/media/activities/attach/1b4467af-e560-4149-ac97-93a60e742d04/astroedu1617-EagleNebulaHST.jpg) \nExample image: Hubble Space Telescope image of the \u201cPillars of Creation\u201d in the Eagle Nebula.

If many of your students play instruments, encourage them ahead of time to bring their own. It\u2019s also possible to do this activity with one instrument that is passed around the class as each student takes turns. If you use one instrument, percussion instruments (drums, shakers) tend to work best.\n* Select one or more images. Possible sources include HST image galleries, observatory image galleries (i.e. ESO, NOAO), or The World at Night. Some suggested images and links are included in the additional information section.\n* Display your images, either by projecting on a screen or providing printouts.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/1b4467af-e560-4149-ac97-93a60e742d04/astroedu1617-HelixNebulaESO.jpg) \nExample image: The Helix Nebula. This is an example of a planetary nebula, the remnants of a Sun-like star that has died. Image credit: ESO. Please find more images on the \u2018Additional Information\u2019 section.\n\n###Step 1 \nGuide students in understanding the image you\u2019ve selected. This should be done as interactively as possible. Ask leading questions, such as:\n- What type of object is depicted in this image (planet, nebula, galaxy, etc.)?\n- What types of astronomical processes are represented by this image (star formation, galaxy collision, planetary geological processes, etc.)?\n- What aspects of the image stand out visually (bright stars, spiral arms of a galaxy, planetary features, etc.)?\n\n\n###Step 2 \nAfter the students understand the image, explain that they will be creating short improvisations based on their reactions to the image. Their improvisations should be based on visual aspects of the image, or the astronomical processes behind the image, or anything else related to the image that the students find interesting. It\u2019s important to emphasize that there are many possibilities; students should not worry about making mistakes.\n\n###Step 3 \nCreate your own improvisation for the students. It\u2019s important that the teacher try first. This provides students an example, and also shows that you as the teacher are willing to take creative risks. \n\n###Step 4 \nGet your instruments ready. If students brought their own instruments, make sure they have their instruments available. If you are providing instruments, distribute them to the class (allow students to choose, and give students a minute or so to experiment with the instruments they\u2019ve selected). If you have one instrument that you\u2019re passing around, ask one student to volunteer to be first and pass the instrument to that student. \n\n###Step 5 \nInvite students to take turns creating 15-30 second improvisations based on the image. The other students should try to explain how the music connects with the image. After a few students have offered explanations, the student creating the improvisation can explain his/her thoughts on how the music relates to the science phenomena depicted in the image.\n\n###Step 6 \nThe student who has just improvised should select who\u2019s next (and pass the instrument if needed). This adds an element of surprise; no one knows who\u2019s next. Make a game out of it! \n\n###Step 7 \nOnce all students have improvised, explore ways to extend the activity if time allows. Invite students to create additional improvisations based on aspects of the image that they haven\u2019t explored yet.

The system characterises the climate based on the native vegetation of an area. It also takes into account annual and monthly temperatures and precipitation, as well as the seasonality of precipitation. \n\n**Continental Climate**\nIn regions with a continental climate, the average temperature is higher than 10\u00b0C during the warm periods and below -3\u00b0C during the coldest ones. Such regions are usually found in the interiors of continents and are far away from the influence of the ocean or large water surfaces. As soil and rock have a much lower heat capacity than water, they gain and lose heat quickly. Continental climates are often found to be relatively dry and most of the water carried by air masses originating from ocean regions far away is lost as rainfall early in the journey. \n\nRegions of the Earth that have continental climates include Siberia and central Russia, and much of North America. Siberia, Canada and the northern states of the US in particular can exhibit very large differences \u2013 up to 40\u00b0C \u2013 between summertime and wintertime average temperatures. \n\n**Oceanic climate**\nOceanic climate is found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents like northwest Europe, the Pacific Northwest region of the USA and Canada, or in southeast Australia.\n\nOceanic climates are characterised by a narrower range of annual temperatures (usually between 0 and 22 \u00b0C) than observed in other places at a comparable latitude, and do not have the extremely dry summers of the Mediterranean regions. Precipitations are more dispersed throughout the year.", "fulldesc": "###Preparation\n-\tFor \u2018Summer and Winter\u2019 activity, you will need to draw a table on the board.\n-\tFor the activity \u2018Sea and land\u2019 make sure that the water and the soil are at the same temperature. You can do this by measuring the temperature of the soil and bringing the water to the same level. You will also need a source of heat. If the sun isn\u2019t shining the day of the experiment, you can use another heat source like a bright lamp kept close to the cups. \n\nThe table should be as follows:\n\n| Measurement 1 (before exposure to the Sun) | Measurement 2 (after exposure to the Sun) | Measurement 3 (15 min. after exposure to the Sun) | \n-|-|-|-|-\ncup of soil (land) | | | \ncup of soil (land) | | | \n\n###Activity 1: Summer and winter \n\n###Step 1:\nRead students the story from Task 1 on the worksheet or get them to read it themselves.\n\n###Step 2:\nAsk the students what the story was about. Where did Ella, Alex and their Dad go? How did the sand feel? And the water?\n\n###Step 3:\nExplain that it is warmer in the middle of the country in the summer than on the coast. In the winter it is warmer on the coast.\n\n###Step 4:\nAsk the students if they can imagine an experiment to explain why.\n\n###Step 5: \nThe students investigate why it is warmer inland in the summer than on the coast.\n\n###Step 6:\nAsk the students why they think it is warmer inland than on the coast in the summer.\n\n###Activity 2: Sea and land\n\n###Step 1:\nExplain that you are going to do an experiment. Ask one of the students to help you. Give this student two identical plastic cups.\n\n###Step 2:\nThe student half fills one cup with soil and the other with water.\n\n###Step 3:\nAsk the students which cup represents the coast? And the middle of the country?\n\n###Step 4:\nExplain that the cup with soil represents the inland climate and the cup with water represents the climate on the coast. \n\n###Step 5:\nPut a thermometer into each cup (do not stick it too deeply into the soil).\n\n###Step 6:\nRemove the thermometers after one minute and read the temperatures together. Explain how if necessary. Write the temperature readings in the table on the board.\n\n###Step 7:\nFor Task 2a ask the students to draw a red circle around the cup that they think will be warmer after the cups have been standing in direct sunlight.\n\n###Step 8:\nNow expose the cups to direct sunlight for five minutes.\n\n###Step 9:\nPut a thermometer in each cup. After one minute, help the students read the temperature on each thermometer.\n\n###Step 10:\nTake the cups out of the sun. After 15 minutes, measure the temperatures of the contents of the cups again.\n\n**Tip: Ensure that the students know how to read a thermometer before beginning the Sea and land activity.**\n\n###Step 11:\nWrite the temperatures for the soil and the water in the table. Look at the answers together. Which cup became warmer in the sun?\n\n###Step 12: \nThe students use a yellow pencil for Task 2b on the worksheet. After 15 minutes, the students complete Task 2c. Did the students draw a circle around the same cup for Tasks 2a, 2b, and 2c? Encourage the students to explain their choices.\n\n###Activity 3: Warm soil, cold soil\n\n###Step 1:\nDiscuss why the cup of soil became warmer than the cup of water. Why do the students think this happened?\n\n###Step 2:\nExplain that this is because the rays of the Sun penetrate deeper into the water than into the land. Therefore, they warm a much larger volume of water. The rays of sunlight on the land do not penetrate much below the surface. This means that only the surface of the land is warm. The surface of the land is warmer than the water as a whole; however, since a smaller volume of land is heated, the land also cools down more quickly.\n\n###Step 3:\nExplain the results of the experiment to the students again by asking them if they have ever dug a deep hole when they were on the beach. What did they notice?\n\n###Step 4:\nCome to the conclusion that the deeper you dig, the colder the sand is. That is because the sunlight is unable to penetrate beyond the top layer of the sand. So the surface gets very hot, but below this it stays cool.\n\n###Step 5:\nExplain that the soil (the land) warms up very quickly, but also cools down quickly. The water (the sea) warms up more slowly, and takes longer to cool down. That is why in summer it is cooler on the coast than inland, and in winter it is warmer on the coast.\n\n###Step 6: \nFor Task 3 on the worksheet, the students colour the areas where it is warmest and coldest.\n\n", "curriculum": "Country| Level | Subject | Exam board | Section\n-|-|-|-|-\nUK | KS1: Year 2 | Maths | - | Measurement: Choose and use appropriate standard units to estimate and measure  temperature (\u00b0C) to the nearest appropriate unit, using thermometers.\nUK | KS1 | Geography | - | Human and physical geography: Identify seasonal and daily weather patterns in the United Kingdom and the location of hot and cold areas of the world in relation to the Equator and the North and South Poles.\nUK | KS1 | Geography | - | Locational knowledge: Locate the world\u2019s countries using maps.

Plants and animals use the air in the atmosphere to survive.\n\nAlthough the atmosphere extends far above the Earth\u2019s surface, most of the air is concentrated in the lowest 5 kilometres (3 miles).  This is because gravity acts on the air, pulling it towards the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe higher you go in the atmosphere, the thinner the air gets.  This means that each breath contains less air (and therefore less oxygen), so mountain-climbers climbing a very high mountain find it harder to breathe the higher they go.\n\nAir is made up of a variety of gases (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) and other particles.\n\nMeteorites or spacecraft approaching the Earth at a high speed can explode when they reach the atmosphere.  The force of the meteorites or spacecraft crashing into the blanket of air we call the atmosphere can release lots of heat.\n\nMeteorites usually disintegrate and burn up when they crash into Earth\u2019s atmosphere (but some survive and made big dents on the Earth called craters). Obviously it would not be good for spacecraft (which can be travelling extremely fast, e.g. 28000 km/hour) to burn up when they re-enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, so various methods are used to prevent this, e.g. reducing their speed and using insulating materials.", "fulldesc": "###Preparation\nAccessing a video of a meteor exploding as it enters the atmosphere would be helpful, e.g. the Chelyabinsk Meteor which exploded over the Urals in Russia in February 2013.

Discuss why the meteorite travelled a long distance through outer space (a vacuum) without exploding, and why it did not wait to explode until it hit the Earth\u2019s surface (it hit the atmosphere). Ask the students to offer some possible explanations.\n\nOther discussions could be based around air being necessary for us to breathe and stay alive; astronauts carrying oxygen with them into space. Can they think of other objects in which air is stored? (tyres of bikes and cars, bubbles, footballs).\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/5d6b3abf-8a0a-4e38-aaf5-a4d16c5836d8/astroedu1603-underwater.jpg) \n \n**Suggested trigger questions:**\n\n- Can you see air? Smell it/ feel it /taste it? (Probably not. But you can hear and feel moving air, e.g. on a windy day or near a fan. And you can see air if there are impurities in it? (e.g. dust in sunlight or smoke).\n- If you take everything (i.e. all the people and all the objects) out of this room, what is left? (Nothing? Are you sure?).\n\nNote: Students test out the following activities individually or in small groups. Students should discuss in small groups or write down what they think is happening in each activity.\n\n###Activity 1: Fill a Balloon with Air\n\n###Step 1: \nTake a balloon and blow it up (i.e. fill it with air but do not let it explode).\n\n###Step 2:\nCan you describe what is happening? (As the air enters the balloon from your lungs, it takes up space in the balloon. The balloon expands because the air inside needs more space).\n\n###Activity 2: Fill a Syringe with Air and Feel the Air Pushing\n\n###Step 1: \nPull the plunger of the syringe out towards you, then push it in again. Was this easy? What was happening inside the syringe? (The syringe was filled with air, which was pushed out again).\n\n###Step 2: \nPull the plunger again, and this time cover the other end of the syringe with your finger. Press down on the plunger. Was this easy? What did you feel? Can you explain what was happening inside the syringe? Was there any difference this time, and if so why? (It is easy to push the plunger a little, but gets difficult because the air trapped inside the syringe resists the plunger. The more compressed the air becomes, the harder it is to push the plunger).\n\n###Step 3: \nLet the plunger go. What happens? (The plunger pops back and then stops). Why do you think this happens? (The air which was compressed in the syringe expands to its original state and pushes the plunger back out).\n\n###Activity 3: Controlling Movement with a Syringe Attached to Each End of Plastic Tubing.\n\n**Using 2 syringes of the same size:**\n\n###Step 1: \nPush the end of one syringe fully in, and attach the tubing to it.\n\n###Step 2: \nPush the end of the other syringe only partially, and attach the tubing to it. (This is to make sure that the syringes are not pushed out of the tubing). \n\n###Step 3:\nPredict what will happen to the other syringe when you push one syringe in and out? Now try and see! (The other syringe moves out). \n\n###Step 4:\nWhy does this happen? (The trapped air has the power to move things). \n\n###Step 5: \nCan you compare how much both the syringes moved? (Approximately the same). \n\n###Step 6: \nRepeat the above activity using two different sized syringes. \n\n###Step 7: \nDo you think the syringes will move the same distance this time? Try and see! What do you notice? Is there any connection between the size of the syringes and the distances they move? (A small syringe pushes a bigger syringe by a small distance. A large syringe can push a small syringe by a much greater distance).\n\n###Activity 4: Fill a Straw with Water from the Top\n\nBlock up the bottom of a narrow straw with a piece of Blu tack. Then fill the straw with water from the top, using a pipette. Was this difficult? If so, why do you think it was not easy? (Air got in the way). Slowly release the Blu tack. What happens and why? (The water moves down, because the air escapes).\n\n###Activity 5: Dry Tissue under Water\n\n###Step 1: \nCrumple up some tissues into a ball and push them tightly into the bottom of a cup, so that they do not fall out when the cup is turned upside down. (A few tissues tightly packed are less likely to fall out than one tissue). Predict what will happen to the water and tissue when you turn the cup upside down in the water.\n\n###Step 2:\nNow turn the cup upside down and place it in water contained in a bowl. Take it out and feel the tissue. What do you notice? Why do you think the tissue did not get wet? (Air prevented the water from going up into the cup).\n\n###Step 3:\nDiscuss where air pockets can occur: in water pipes, capsized canoes, central heating radiators, etc.\n\n###Step 4: \n\n- Discuss what a vacuum is.\n- What do you call the layer of air surrounding the Earth? (The atmosphere).\n- What happens when things crash into the atmosphere? (Discussion could include the heat caused by friction. Students can rub or clap their hands \u2013 what do they feel? Planes catch fire when they crash because of the intense heat).\n- Think of spacecraft returning to the Earth at a high speed after a mission in Space, what do they encounter first? (Air, i.e. the atmosphere). What you think it has to do? (Slow down). Otherwise what would happen? (It would break and burn up).\n- How do you think a spacecraft can be prevented from burning up? (It is covered in insulating materials, and also it slows down).\n\n**Safety:**\nIn Activity 3, always use sterile syringes that have not been used for medical purposes. Be careful with the sizes of syringes \u2013 a big syringe could push out a small syringe with great force.\n\n**Maths:**\nDisplay these questions for the students to answer.\n\n1) Air is a mixture of gases that consists of carbon dioxide, argon and very small amounts of other gases.\n\n- Approximately what percentage of the air consists of (i) nitrogen and (ii) oxygen?\n- What is the approximate ratio of nitrogen to oxygen in the air?\n- Can you convert the three percentages above to decimals?\n\n2) In Activity 3, use two different-sized syringes connected by tubing, calculate the ratio of the sizes of syringes. Then measure the distances that the two syringes moved.\n\n- Is there any connection between these two ratios?\n-  Investigate which combination of syringes gives the greatest movement.\n\n**Analysis/Conclusion:** Air takes up space (even though you cannot see it).\n\n###Follow-up activity: Filling a Bottle Using a Funnel\n\n###Step 1: \nPut the funnel into the mouth of the bottle and ask the students to predict what will happen when they pour water into the funnel.\n\n###Step 2:\nAsk them to pour water into the funnel and observe what happens (The water fills the bottle).\n\n###Step 3:\nNow, secure the funnel to the bottle such that there is no space between the two. **THIS SPACE MUST BE TOTALLY AIRTIGHT.** The students again predict what will happen when they pour water into the funnel. They then pour water into the funnel.\n\n**Note:** It can be difficult to get an airtight seal. A rubber O-ring, available in DIY stores, placed around the neck of the funnel and then pressing down on the funnel by hand can produce a good seal. Tape, well-sealed, may work also).\n\n###Step 4:\nObserve what happens. What do you see? What do you hear? Why was it hard for the water to enter? (Air inside the bottle got in the way). What else do you notice? (In case of a fully airtight seal, no water will enter the bottle because the air gets in the way and cannot escape. If there is a slight air leak, there is a glug- glug sound of some water getting in while bubbles of air escape).\n\n###Students Can:\n\n- Find out more about central heating radiators not giving out much heat because of air getting trapped in them \u2013 \u2018air locks\u2019, and how this air is released.\n- Explore the five different layers which make up the atmosphere \u2013 find out their names, and at what approximate level you will find clouds, aeroplanes, the ozone layer, satellites, the International Space Station, etc. See the additional information section for links.\n\n###Did You Know?\nIn October 2014 Space X Dragon Spacecraft, returning to the Earth carrying a cargo of biological samples (including plants grown in space) from the International Space Station, produced intense heat as it entered the atmosphere. The temperature was nearly 3000\u00ba Fahrenheit (1649\u00baCelsius). It was protected from burning by a very strong heat shield.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/5d6b3abf-8a0a-4e38-aaf5-a4d16c5836d8/astroedu1603-space-station.jpg) \nImage credit: NASA/SpaceX\n\nOn Monday, 19 January 2015 an amateur photographer captured a fireball over Dalkey Island, south Co.

So each part of that area gets less heat than when the light from the Sun is concentrated on a smaller area. At the Equator the Sun shines vertically on the Earth's surface, so it falls on a smaller area. This means it is warmer at the Equator.\n\n###Step 4:\nTogether, look at the drawings on the worksheet. Use your orange to show that the Earth is tilted slightly diagonally. Rotate the orange around the torch. Start with the North Pole turned away from the Sun. Now the students can see that sometimes the North Pole is turned towards the Sun, and sometimes away from it.\n\n ![](/media/activities/attach/ea56ceb4-19e9-499f-9774-63eb57355053/astroEDU1604-torch-globe.jpg)\n\n###Step 5:\nShow that the Sun shines more directly on the Northern Hemisphere when the North Pole is turned towards the Sun than when the North Pole is turned away from it. Explain that the seasons on Earth are caused by the different angles at which the Sun's rays hit the earth. This is why it is hotter in the summer than in winter. Discuss with the students that the sunlight never falls vertically on Europe. You can explain that this because there are always shadows. Even in the middle of the summer at noon when the Sun is highest on the sky, it is still not vertically above us.\n\n###Step 6:\nThe students complete the rest of Task 2 on the worksheet. Say that in Europe (or anywhere not on the Equator) the Sun shines for a shorter time in the winter than it does in the summer. Say that this is because of the angle of the Sun in relation to the surface of the Earth. Because the angle of the Sun shining on Europe changes throughout the year, we experience different seasons. This is because the amount of heat and light changes.\n\n###Activity 3: Seasons are not different everywhere\n\nThe students complete Task 3 on the worksheet. Ask them why we have such different seasons in Europe, while the countries on the Equator do not. Conclude that this is because of the changing angle at which the midday Sun shines on the Earth's surface in Europe, whereas it is more constant at the Equator. Refer back to the activity Vertical or shallow angle.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/ea56ceb4-19e9-499f-9774-63eb57355053/astroEDU1604-seasons.jpg) ", "curriculum": "Country| Level | Subject | Exam board | Section\n-|-|-|-|-\nUK | KS1:Year 1 | Science | - | Seasonal changes: Observe and describe the weather associated with the seasons and how day length varies.\nUK | KS1 | Geography | - | Human and physical geography: Identify seasonal and daily weather patterns in the United Kingdom and the location of hot and cold areas of the world in relation to the Equator and the North and South Poles.\nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Science | - | Earth and space: Describe the movement of the Earth, and other planets, relative to the Sun in the solar system.", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "In three steps, this activity teachers how to build a model of the Earth and helps students understand the concept of seasons around the world.

Students observe that light falling on a surface diagonally covers a larger surface area than light falling from directly overhead and discover that the Sun warms a smaller area more quickly than a large area.\n\n", "alert_message": "", "short_desc_material": "There is 1 attachment called Student Worksheet PDF for this activity.

In the Southern Hemisphere, all the stars move around a very dark area called the Coalsack. Nowadays, the North Star always shows the direction of true north and is only visible in the Northern Hemisphere. The Coalsack shows the direction of south and is only visible in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/1.jpg) \n\nConstellations are patterns of stars which form imaginary figures and which always seem to be in the same position relative to each other. The North Star is one of the tail stars of the Little Dipper constellation. You can see the Big Dipper, Cassiopeia and the Little Dipper, among others, in the sky. If you watch the night sky from a dark spot, you will see them easily. The most difficult one to find is the Little Dipper because the light of its stars is weaker. Start by finding the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia. Then try to find the Little Dipper by using the position of the three constellations as seen in the diagram. If you look at these constellations again an hour later, you will see that they have revolved around the North Star.\n\n**Where is the Sun**\n\nBy looking at the horizon and knowing the direction of sunrise and sunset, we can tell in which direction we are moving. To turn back, you simply turn around and go back in the opposite direction.\nThis is easy when we are on land. We only need to take a fix on one or two points on the horizon and go the opposite way, changing the reference points on  the  right  to  the  left  and  the  points  on  the  left  to  the right. Of course, if you have a compass you can tell which direction is north, which is south and where the other cardinal points lie. But it is also possible to find your way without a compass, because for instance, in Portugal the midday sun is always in the south.\n\n**The position of the Sun throughout the day**\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/2.jpg) \n\nSunrise in the East --- Sunset in the West\n\n*The position of the Sun in the Northern hemisphere above the Tropic of Cancer*\n\nFinding our way at night, in the desert, or at sea is more difficult as we cannot see any reference points on the horizon. In the Northern Hemisphere, the North Star is always in the north and is visible at night. So if we turn to the North Star, the Sun will always rise on our right and set on our left. If you live in Cape Verde, which lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, you can still see the North Star in the north. But, depending on the season, the midday sun may be north or south of your position. If we travel to the Earth\u2019s Southern Hemisphere like Portuguese navigators from the 15th century on, we can no longer see the North Star. But the Coalsack will always show us the way south.\n\nNote that there are different ways to find the North and South poles. For instance, in the Northern Hemisphere finding Cassiopeia is important but not necessary. See: http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070108.html\nIn the Southern Hemisphere: there are at least different 4 different methods of finding the south pole, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole#Finding_the_south_celestial_pole  \n\n**Some instruments for navigation**\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/3.jpg) \n\nA quadrant is an instrument developed by Ptolemy and later improved by medieval Muslim astronomers. Navigators used it to measure their latitude. They would look at a star through the sights and hold the quadrant until the plane was vertical. The altitude of the North Star as measured with a quadrant corresponds to your latitude if you are in the Northern Hemisphere. Navigators would also use the instrument with the altitude of the centre of the sun, and by looking in front of them with the sun on their side to avoid having to stare at it. \n \n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/4.jpg) \n\n**Latitude**\n\nBy observing the Sun, and the regularity of the Earth\u2019s rotation around the Sun, astronomers and geographers were able to find practical ways to determine our position on Earth.\n\nLocations to the north and south of the Equator were marked along circular parallel lines drawn around the Earth. These lines are called the parallels and their positions are measured in degrees: the Equator is the Zero Degree line, the North Pole is at a 90\u00ba N angle to the Equator and the South Pole lies at a 90\u00ba S angle to the Equator. The measurement of the north- south position is called latitude.\n\nTo determine the latitude of a location during the day, in addition to knowing the angle of the midday sun above the horizon, the date, your approximate position on Earth, you also need to know if you are in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere and your position relative to the tropics. In the Northern Hemisphere the angle of the North Star above the horizon is the latitude of your location.\n\nThe latitude of a location is the measurement of the angle if you travel from the Equator to the parallel which passes through this location, perpendicular to the Equator. At any time of night, this angle is equal to the angle of the North Star above the horizon. Measuring latitude is easy, because in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Star is always visible in the night sky.\n \n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/5.jpg) \n\n**Longitude**\n\nLatitude only gives information about one part of the location on a globe. To give full information about the location of a place, we need to use a second reference showing where the horizontal location on the globe is.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/6.jpg) \n\nMeridians or longitude lines link the North and the South poles on the globe, like the segments of a satsuma. Each meridian crosses the equator line. As the equator is a circle, we can divide it in 360\u00b0. For historical reasons and since 1884, the count starts with the line crossing the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, in London, UK. This is known as the prime meridian, where the longitude is defined as 0\u00b0. . Moving east of the Prime Meridian, the longitude is measured in degrees east up to 180\u00b0, e.g. Paris has longitude 2.4\u00b0E. Similarly moving west, longitude is measured  in degrees west, e.g. Lisbon has longitude 9.1\u00b0W.\n\nIf we know the latitude and the longitude of a place, we can localize it on the globe. It is called the coordinate.\n\n**Units of longitude and latitude**\n\nBoth longitude and latitude are measured in degrees. For a more specific location, fractions of a degree can be used. Alternatively, in a similar way to hours, degrees can also be subdivided into arcminutes (') and arcseconds (\u201c), with 60' in a degree and 60\u201d in an arcminute. So the tilt of the Earth, 23\u00b030' is equal to 23.5\u00b0. This exercise uses fractions of a degree.", "fulldesc": "###Activity 1: Our position on Earth: latitude\n\n###Step 1:\nStudents find their city on the globe. Use the app which shows you the view of the night sky on an iPad or mobile phone based on your location. The app can do this based on your location or you can type in your location (or the location of your nearest city).\n\n###Step 2:\nIf there is one device for the class, ask for a volunteer to locate the North Star if you are in the Northern hemisphere or the Coalsack if you are in the Southern hemisphere.\n\n###Step 3:\nThe student rotates and moves the device around until they find the North Star or Coalsack. Use the compass included on the app or another student can use a compass to find North or South as appropriate. Ways to locate these objects are included in the background information.\n\n###Step 4:\nOnce they have located the object ask them to keep pointing the device in the same direction.\n\n###Step 5:\nAsk for a second student to measure the angle of the North Star or Coalsack above the floor/ horizon with a protractor. Alternatively if you have a quadrant, the night sky view can be presented on a vertical screen and students look through a quadrant to measure the angle of the object above the horizon. This activity could also use a quadrant to look at the real night sky on a clear night. \n\n###Step 6:\nStudents note the angle they found. (This angle is the latitude of the place you are in).\n\n###Step 7:\nAsk students if everyone sees the North star (or Coalsack) at the same angle? Why/why not? Try inputting different locations around the world in both hemispheres and measuring the angles of the north star (or coalsack if you saw this in your location) above the horizon or noting if you cannot see it. Point out where they are on the globe to compare. Come to the conclusion that people in the Northern hemisphere can see the north star (and people in the southern hemisphere cannot) but see it at different angles depending on their location (or equivalent with the Southern hemisphere and the coalsack). Explain that this angle tells us how North or South we are. This is called our latitude. Write this word on the board.\n\n###Step 8:\nShow students the lines of latitude on the globe. Have they heard of the equator and do they know where it is? Show them and explain that the equator goes around the middle of the Earth. We label the equator 0\u00b0. If we travel north, the angle increases until we reach the North Pole which is at 90\u00b0N, and travelling south from the equator, the angle increases to the South Pole at 90\u00b0S.\n\n###Step 9:\nAsk students how we could use this information. Come to the conclusion that we could measure the angle of the North star/ Coalsack to find our latitude and help find our location on Earth, as explorers travelling by sea did.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/astroedu1609-cape-verde.png) \n\n###Activity 2: Our position on Earth: longitude\n\n###Step 1:\nAsk students if knowing how North or South we are is enough to pinpoint our exact position on Earth. The answer is no. Even knowing how North or South we are, we could still be anywhere along the same parallel line, e.g. Nice in France and Toronto in Canada are both at a latitude of 43.7\u00b0 but are very far away from each other.\n\n###Step 2:\nAsk students to say/ point out the location of the two different cities on the globe. Ask students if they can think of another piece of information they could use to distinguish the two cities: how are they different?\n\n###Step 3:\nCome to the conclusion the horizontal position on the globe, i.e. the East-West location are what separates them. Explain we divide the globe using lines from the North to the South pole, like the segments of a satsuma. Ask students to point out the lines on the globe. Explain we call these lines of longitude and write this word on the board.\n\n###Step 4:\nAsk students to imagine getting on a plane and flying in a plane travelling East. The plane would travel in a circle. Ask students how many degrees there are in a circle. Answer: 360\u00b0.\n\n###Step 5:\nAsk students if there is anywhere obvious to start counting the lines of longitude from? No, there isn't as the Earth is a sphere. Explain that in 1884 it was agreed that the line passing through London would be the Prime Meridian with a longitude of 0\u00b0. Moving East, the angle increases up to 90\u00b0E and then 180\u00b0. Moving west from the prime meridian, the angle increases up to 90\u00b0W and then up to 180\u00b0.\n\n###Step 6:\nStudents use the globe or a world map to find the longitude of their location. They note the result. Students can now give the full coordinates, longitude and latitude, of their location. \n \n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/7.jpg) \n\n###Step 7:\nAsk students if they know of a way to find your location more precisely than using a globe. Can we use technology? How can you navigate in a car?\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/astroedu1609-world-map.jpg) \n\n###Step 8:\nExplain that today, we are able to give much more precise coordinates for a location using the Global Positioning System (GPS). This is a network of satellites orbiting the Earth in space used for navigation. If a GPS receiver can 'see', i.e. communicate, with four or more of these satellites, its location can be found by using a triangulation technique.\n\n###Activity 3: Direction of the Sun \n\nCape Verde is just off the west coast of northern Africa with a latitude of 15\u00b0N, placing it between the equator (0\u00b0) and the Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u00b0N). Using this knowledge, we investigate why the inhabitants of Cape Verde sometimes see the midday sun in the north and at other times in the south. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/astroedu1609-latitudes.png) \n\n###Step 1:\nMake sure students can all see the globe. Ask students to find their location, the Equator and the north-south axis on the globe. Could wrap a piece of string around globe to show location of the equator.\n\n###Step 2: \nLight up the globe with a lamp and tilt the axis slightly towards the light so that the area around the North Pole, outlined by the Arctic Circle, is lit up. Place a pencil against the globe and move it vertically between the North and South poles on the globe. Show that if you move the pencil to the north, its shadow will point north and the Sun will be to the south. If you move the pencil towards the south, its shadow will point south because the midday sun is to the north.\n\n###Step 3:\nAsk students what they observe. Moving northwards, ask which direction is the shadow pointing in if the pencil is above the Sun?  (To the south). Moving southwards, ask which direction is the shadow pointing in if the pencil is below the Sun? (To the North). They should also be able to see that there is a point where the pencil casts no shadow.\n\n###Step 4:\nTell students there is a circle of latitude, like the equator but it does not go around the middle of the Earth. It is called the 'Tropic of Cancer' and is at 23.5\u00ba north of the equator. Can they use what they learnt earlier to work out where this is? Place the pencil against it at this latitude. \n\n###Step 5:\nTilt the axis so that there is no shadow when the pencil is on the Tropic of Cancer. The axis of the globe is now inclined 23.5\u00ba relative to the vertical. For anyone standing on the surface of the  Earth at  the  point where  the  pencil meets the  globe and  who  can  see the  Sun  in  the  position of  the  lamp,  it  is  midday  on  June 21st.\n\n###Step 6:\nTell students the latitude of Cape Verde is 15\u00b0N. Can they work out where this is on the globe? Is it north or south of the Tropic of Cancer? You may wish to place a sticker to indicate its location.\n\n###Step 7:\nKeeping the same tilt as above (so the Sun is directly above the Tropic of Cancer), move the pencil to the location of Cape Verde. Ask students in which direction the shadow is pointing (should be to the south).\n\n###Step 8:\nNow move the Earth/ globe so that is on the opposite side of the Sun/ lamp to represent six months later. The north axis should now be pointing away from the Sun at the same angle so the South pole is lit. Ensure that Cape Verde is pointing towards the Sun. Ask students over which part of the Earth is the Sun directly over and demonstrate as before with the shadow of the pencil. (The Sun is directly over the Tropic of Capricorn which is 23.5\u00baS). \n\n###Step 9:\nPlace the pencil on Cape Verde. Ask students what they notice about the direction of the shadow. (It is now pointing to the North).\n\t\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/astroedu1609-pencil.jpg) \n  \n###Step 10:\nSo people in Cape Verde sometimes have midday shadows to the North or the South depending on the time of year because the direction of the midday sun changes during the year. In fact, all people who can see the midday sun to the north or south at different times of the year live between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.\n\n###Step 11:\nThe answer to our question is simple. As the north-south axis of the Earth is inclined relative to the plane of   the Earth\u2019s orbit, the midday sun on the first day of summer south of the Tropic of Cancer will be in the north. But in the autumn, between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer, the midday sun will be in the south.", "curriculum": "Country| Level | Subject | Exam board | Section\n-|-|-|-|-\nUK | KS2 | Geography | - | Locational knowledge:  identify the position and significance of latitude, longitude, Equator, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circle, the Prime/Greenwich Meridian and time zones (including day and night).\nUK | KS3 | Geography | - | Geographical skills and fieldwork: build on their knowledge of globes, maps and atlases and apply and develop this knowledge routinely in the classroom and in the field.\nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Science | - | Earth and Space: use the idea of the Earth\u2019s rotation to explain day and night and the apparent movement of the sun across the sky.\nUK | KS2: Year 5 | Maths | - | Geometry- properties of shapes: draw given angles, and measure them in degrees (o).\nUK | KS3 | Maths | - | Geometry and measures: draw and measure line segments and angles in geometric figures, including interpreting scale drawing.", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "With this activity, students learn that the Earth is a globe and that we can define a position on the globe by using latitude and longitude.

With very few exceptions inside our own solar system, we cannot travel to our objects of study. Instead, we need to infer the properties of stars, nebulae and planets from our observations. Knowing an object's distance is key to such cosmic detective work. If all we knew were an object's apparent brightness in the sky, we couldn't distinguish between objects that are fairly near but not very bright and those that are far away but emit lots of light!\n\nThis is evident when it comes to some of the most basic celestial objects: stars. Our direct experience on a clear night is that stars are tiny pinpricks of light. A simple flashlight will give us much more illumination than all the thousands of stars we see in a starry night taken together. But the Sun is a star, too, and it is the brightest object most of us will ever experience \u2013 so bright that it poses a danger to our eyes, and we shouldn\u2019t look at it directly! Yet some of the stars we see at night emit much more light than our Sun. The key factor that makes them appear much less bright, for an\nobserver here on Earth, is distance. The only difference is distance. Even the closest star, Alpha Centauri, is more than 265 000 times far away from us compared to the Sun.\n\nEstimating cosmic distances is a difficult task. Even distances within our own Solar System are sizeable by everyday standards. The astronomical unit, corresponding to the average distance of the Earth from the Sun, is about 150 million kilometres. \n\nThe nearest star, Alpha Centauri, is 4\u00b710<sup>13</sup> km away. Such giant numbers are unwieldy, and astronomers have introduced an alternative way of stating distances. Nothing moves faster than light, and astronomers have taken to using light travel times as their measure of the distances to the nearest stars  (parsecs, and its derivatives, as well as redshifts are used for greater distances). The Sun, for instance, is about 8 light-minutes away from us: light takes 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to us. Alpha Centauri is 4.2 light-years away. \n\n(Do not be confused by the occurrence of words like \u2018minute\u2019 or \u2018year\u2019 in these units. Light-minutes and light-years are measures of distance, not of time.)\n\nThe most distant objects we know are much farther away. Light takes billions of years to cover the distance between those objects and us, so these objects are billions of light-years away (corresponding to tens of sextillions, or 10<sup>22</sup>, of kilometres). No single method can cover this immense range of distances. Instead, astronomers rely on what they call the cosmic distance ladder: a set of complementary methods of determining distances, where methods applied to more distant objects are calibrated using methods applicable to less distant objects. \n\n**Apparent brightness: inverse square formula**\n\nA number of key methods of measuring astronomical distances involve the following basic principle: Assume that we know how much light an object emits (this is called 'luminosity'). We can measure the object's apparent brightness in the sky. Comparison of luminosity and apparent brightness is directly related to the object's distance from us. Quantitatively, assume that the objects emits energy per second L, and that this emission does not favour any particular direction (isotropic emission). L is called the object's luminosity. At a distance d from the object, this total energy will have spread out over a spherical surface of area 4 pi d<sup>2</sup>. Imagine that our detector \u2013 for instance, our telescope mirror \u2013 covers an area A, as shown in the following figure, which is at a distance d from the radiating object O:\n \n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535-inverse-square.png) \n\nSince the object's light emission is spread evenly over the whole sphere, our detector will only receive a fraction A/(4 pi d<sup>2</sup>) of that emission; in other words, our detector will receive energy per second\n\nF = L\u0387A/(4 pi d<sup>2</sup>)\n\nfrom the object. We can rewrite this formula by dividing out the detector area to yield the intensity of the radiation\n\nI = F/A = L/(4 pi d<sup>2</sup>), \n\nthat is, the amount of energy per second per unit detector area reaching us from a particular object. This is the famous \u2018inverse square law\u2019 for radiation. Typical classroom demonstrations of the inverse square law involve a photodetector, such as a small solar cell, placed at varying distances from a light source (e.g. Stanger 2008). \n\n**Standard candles**\n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535_galaxy.jpg) \nImage: Supernovae of type Ia, such as this one in 1994 in the galaxy NGC 4526, are standard candles that allow astronomers to deduce the distance of far-away galaxies.

CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode\n\nThe inverse square law links the quantities I, L, and d. Imagine a class of objects whose members all have the same luminosity L. Such objects are called standard candles. Whenever we observe a standard candle, we know its luminosity L, can measure the intensity I, and use the inverse square law to calculate the object's distance.\n\nSo-called supernovae of type Ia are the most important standard candles for very distant galaxies, in the context of cosmology, the science of the universe as a whole. These supernovae are violent, thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars. They are extremely bright, and visible over great distances. A supernova's type can be identified from the properties of the light we receive from the explosion (more concretely, from the spectrum of the supernova). Once it is clear that one is indeed observing a supernova of this type, the (maximum) luminosity of the explosion can be deduced.\n\nFor most astronomical standard candles, L is not constant for all objects within the class, but instead is correlated with a measurable property of objects of this kind. The most famous example are Cepheid variable stars, which show periodic changes in brightness. The period of these changes is correlated with the luminosity of the stars; measure the period, and you can deduce the luminosity L. This correlation was first noticed and exploited by Henrietta Swan Leavitt in 1908-1912.\n\nStandard candles like this have played a key role in the history of astronomy. In the early 20th century, Cepheids were used to show that our galaxy is just one among many. And in the final years of the 20th century, type Ia supernovae were used to show that cosmic expansion is accelerating \u2013 the discovery of \u2018Dark Energy\u2019, which was rewarded with the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nThe ideal standard candle would be exceedingly bright, and thus visible over large distances, it would be easily identifiable (e.g. via the determination of a spectrum), and it would be reasonably common to allow for a wide range of distance determinations. Ideally, we would have some very close examples of this type of standard candle in our cosmic neighbourhood, which allows for calibrating the standard candle (that is, measuring its luminosity L) and many very distant examples that allow for distance determinations of galaxies as well as for cosmological measurements.\n\nIn reality, no single standard candle meets all the criteria at once. Instead, astronomers have built a distance ladder of standard candles. For instance, for nearly 300 Cepheid variables, their distance can be measured directly using basic geometry (stellar parallax). These known distances can be used to calibrate the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Once this relation is known, we can examine nearby supernovae of type Ia in galaxies that harbour Cepheids. Using the Cepheid distances, we can determine the peak luminosities of supernovae of type Ia. Once we know these luminosities, we can use supernovae of type Ia as standard candles that are so bright they can be seen to substantial extragalactic and cosmological distances.\n\nThe activity presented here allows your students to discover and explore the key principles of standard candles for themselves, using a simple example in an everyday setting.\n\n**Standard candles and the inverse square law**\n\nIn practice, quantitatively measuring intensities is a challenging task, which requires careful calibration of one's instruments markedly beyond the scope of this activity. Instead, we will make use of the fact that we are making our measurements of various sources with one and the same piece of equipment, our digital camera. \n\nAssuming that we receive light of intensity I from an object, our camera will gather a total amount of light per second corresponding to P = I\u0387A\u0387\u03b7, where A is the collecting area of the camera and \u03b7 < 1 is a dimensionless constant that allows us to encode (a) that some light will be absorbed within the camera lens and (b) some light might not reach the camera chip but be scattered elsewhere. The total energy deposited on the chip is E = P\u0387t, where t is the exposure time. Assume that in our image the object in question spans a certain pixel region and assume a linear response of the chip and linear processing, then E will be proportional to the sum S of the pixel values for that region. (An optional part of the activity involves testing this linearity.)\n\nWhat greatly simplifies our task is that the pixel value sum S depends linearly on the intensity I. As long as we take care to take all our images under the same conditions (same exposure time, same lens, same settings), this linearity means that we can compare the intensities I<sub>1,2</sub> of different sources by comparing the sums S<sub>1,2</sub> of the pixel values for the images of these sources,\n\nS<sub>1</sub>/S<sub>2</sub> = I<sub>1</sub>/I<sub>2</sub>.\n\nIt does not get simpler than this, and this simple formula, together with the inverse square formula linking luminosity, intensity and distance, will be the foundation of the following activity.\n\n**How to undertake this activity?**\n\nThis activity can be undertaken at different levels, depending both on the degree of independence of the activity (i.e. how much is prepared beforehand by the teacher) and on the level of analysis.\u2028As far as preparations are concerned, at the most basic level, the teacher scouts one or more likely locations, takes care to set up the necessary software and prepares simplified recipes for using the software. Students can then concentrate on the science, namely on the measurements and their evaluation. This level of preparation allows for the quickest completion of the exercise. If, on the other hand, the exercise is set up as a completely free inquiry, students need to find their own location, do research on what software they need (e.g. to convert raw images either to FITS or another suitable format for their analysis) and install what they need. This makes for a much more realistic experience, as such preparations are a standard part of astronomical research. Naturally, it also makes the exercise that much more time-intensive.\u2028The most basic level of analysis directly uses the inverse square formula to relate measured brightness to distance, using a reference object for which the distance has been measured by conventional means (either directly or using a map, e.g. Google Maps). This version of the exercise concentrates on the fundamental concept to be learned and allows for quickest completion.\n\nAs an additional activity, the role of the digital camera can be explored. As shown above, use of the camera to measure apparent brightness via simple ratios of pixel value sums relies on a linear relation between the amount of light received from a certain region of the scenery and brightness values for the corresponding image pixels. This linearity can be checked in optional supplemental activities that, at the same time, can be the first steps towards more advanced astrophotography activities. At a more advanced level, students should be encouraged to think about causes of the deviation of their derived distances from the directly measured distances. Two fundamental causes they are likely to encounter are intrinsic brightness variations (that is, deviations from the standard candle assumption) and obscuration (an object\u2019s light being dimmed by intervening matter). Both have their analogues in astronomy, where the simple standard candle assumption (same intrinsic brightness) often needs to be refined (e.g. for Supernovae of type Ia, by making use of a correlation between the supernova light curve\u2019s evolution over time and its peak brightness), and where dust and gas clouds can dim the light of a distant source. In this exercise, we are in the fortunate situation of being able to get close to (\u2018travel to\u2019) our light sources, and measure their intrinsic brightness directly. Students can make these measurements and apply a corresponding correction to their distance derivation; this should reduce the deviation considerably. We can also identify obstructions in the worked-out example; for instance, those street lights that appear dimmer than expected indeed turn out to be obscured by tree branches. While the more advanced level takes considerably more time, it teaches valuable skills in analysing data and error sources.\n\nA worked-out example with brightness measurements and corrections, including sample images and a sample spreadsheet, can be found at http://www.haus-der-astronomie.de/materials/distances/street-lights ", "fulldesc": "This description begins with the basic version, where the teacher has already scouted a suitable location with standard-candle street lights and prepared the necessary software. Suggestions for more advanced versions are also given.\n\n**Preparations by the Teacher:**\n\nFind a street with suitable street lights. Lights are suitable when they are all of the same type or build, and whenever geometric effects do not dominate the measurement (flat, near-horizontal street lights for instance will probably be dominated by perspective/projection effects). \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535_laterne.png) \nImage: Example for a lantern that appears approximately isotropical for a ground-level observer.\n\nThe street lights should shine as isotropically as possible; for practical purposes, all kinds of street lights that are not collimated (e.g. by an egg crate structure) should work.\n\nPrepare a software pipeline for data-taking and analysis. The worked-out example, accessible via the link given below, uses Fitswork (http://www.fitswork.de/software/softw_en.php) to convert raw Canon images (.CR2) into FITS, preserving linearity. Different conversion methods are possible, many of them based on dcraw (https://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/). For measuring object brightness, use ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). This software has the advantage of also being of interest for astrophotography (e.g. as AstroImageJ, http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/), so students might be able to re-use their software skills in other, more advanced projects.\n\nFor an advanced version of this exploration, scouting the location and finding a software solution can be left to the students, although some guidance is bound to be necessary.\n\n###Step 1: Exploring digital images\nIn this step, students explore the meaning of pixel values in a digital image. They are given the following guiding questions:\n\nUsing the software provided, examine images you have taken with the digital camera.\u2028\n\n- What is the relation between pixel values and brightness?\n- How can you capture the brightness of an object in the image?\u2028\n\nThis step should include the students taking test images of a light source and examining the images using their analysis software.\n\nLet the students experiment with different exposures; they should discover that each pixel saturates at a certain brightness, so care needs to be taken with exposure times when taking images for brightness measurements: Saturated regions can introduce significant errors!\n\nAt the end of this step, students should be familiar with whatever software they or their teacher have chosen for this exploration. They should know how to convert raw images from their digital camera to FITS or another suitable format, and how to measure object brightness in their images (namely by something akin to the sum of pixel brightness for the pixel region that includes the object). Depending on the time available for the exercise, this step of the exploration can also include an experiment to test linearity. There are at least two possibilities for this. For the first kind of measurement, a light source (e.g. a shielded lamp or LED) is photographed with the digital camera using different exposure times, demonstrating linearity as exposure time is plotted against brightness. Alternatively, one can leave the camera setup unchanged and photograph one and the same light source, varying the source's distance from the camera. In that case, as long as linearity holds, one should recover the inverse-square law for the different distance-dependent values of image brightness. Non-linearity will lead to a deviation from this simple law.\n\nAs an activity that can take place in the classroom, and during daytime, either experiment can serve as preparation for the activity in the field, and allow the students to get to grips with handling the camera and analysis pipeline.\n\n(If there is time, then the comparison of linearity measurements based on JPG images versus raw images transformed to FITS can vividly demonstrate why it is necessary to work with raw images!)\n\n###Step 2: Street light measurements in the field\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535_receding-streetlights.png) \nImage: Line of street lights receding about 600 meters into the distance. Inset: Zoomed-in image of the most distance of lights.\n\nIn this step, students go to the location chosen by the teacher (are their main targets) in suitably dark conditions (evening/night) and take an image or images of the row of street lights that are their main targets. Different strategies are possible. In the worked-out example, you can find all street lights in one image. Alternatively, one could take one image per street light, centring each light source in the image used to measure its brightness. (This amounts to a field trip in the night-time; teachers should make sure to take appropriate precautions to ensure their students' safety.)\n\nDrawing on what they learned in Step 1 about saturation, students should take images at different exposure times (or, alternatively, different ISO values and aperture values) so as to be sure to obtain at least one image that is not saturated.\u2028For one street lamp (typically the nearest!), the distance to the camera should be measured directly, e.g. using measuring tape or a laser distance measuring device. This distance will be used to calibrate the standard candle measurements.\n\n###Step 3: Image analysis\nOnce the image or images used for measurement have been taken, they can be analysed. In the worked-out example, this is done by converting the images into FITS images and then measuring the brightness of those areas of the image that contain the various street lights. Under suitably dark conditions, background brightness should not play a significant role in the measurements. If backgrounds are bright, or if the students suspect this to be a significant source of error, suitable selection tools should be used to ascertain that the areas used for brightness measurements only contain contributions from the street lights. When background brightness is not a problem, as in the\u2028worked-out example, lamp brightness can be measured using simple rectangular or elliptical selection tools. Measured values should be tabulated, for instance in a spreadsheet (such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc or Google Sheets). The values are not in any of the usual physical units, but since they have been measured in the same way, they should be in the same (unusual) units, allowing for the calculation of ratios. Using the reference street light, whose distance has been measured directly, as well as the inverse square law for intensity, the (standard candle) distances of the other street lights can now be calculated.\n\n###Step 4: Cross-check\nIn astronomy, we need to cross-check different methods of distance determination against each other in order to probe their validity. In the street light example, there are various ways for alternative (and more direct) distance measurements for comparison.\u2028\n\nWhen street lights are aligned alongside a straight road, direct measurement of the distances between the street lights, and from two of the street lights to the location of the camera, will yield sufficient information to calculate (using simple linear equations) each street light's distance from the camera.\n\nDirect measurements are the most easily understood, but have a disadvantage in terms of timing: Those direct measurements should not be made at the same time as the field work in Step 2 (as this might leave students wondering why they need to make the standard candle measurement at all, or cause them to conflate the measurements). Having two separate field measurements, however, means a considerable investment in time and, possibly, logistical planning. \n\nAlternatively, the cross-check can be made online, using available online maps (such as Google Maps or Open Street Map, https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Distance measurements can be either made in the classic mode of Google Maps or by taking a screen shot and measuring distances in image processing software such as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp (http://www.gimp.org/). In parallel with the standard candle analysis, it makes sense to use these tools to determine the street lights\u2019 relative distances from the camera; the reference street light can be used to convert this to linear distances.\u2028\n\nThe results should be plotted to check the validity of the method, comparing directly measured and standard candle values for the various street lights. \u2028\n\n###Step 4 (advanced): Error sources\u2028\nWhen standard candle distances for the street lights and their directly measured counterparts are plotted against lamp number (or each other), the result will not quite be a straight line. \n\nIn advanced versions of the exploration, students are invited to think about the reason(s) for these deviations. \n\nStudents should realise that some of the deviations are random - that both imaging and measurement is likely to introduce small errors that can go in either direction. \n\nTwo kinds of systematic errors are particularly important, as they have analogues in astronomical distance measurements, and as they are reasonably likely to occur in the street light exercise.\n\nThe first systematic error comes from the limitation of the standard candle assumption. While street lights of the same type are likely to be very close in brightness, there are probably some intrinsic variations. For instance, there might be aging effects of the light source used. In astronomy, we cannot visit our standard candles to directly measure their intrinsic brightness; this necessitates systematic tests using alternative methods of distance measurement to determine whether or not standard candle candidates of a certain type show variations depending on various measurable candidate quantities (e.g. for supernovae Ia, peak brightness variations that correlate with the shape of the light curve).\n\nIn the street light exercise, students can instead try to measure intrinsic brightness variations directly, e.g. by walking up to the various street lights and taking images of them from some standard distance under some standard angle (for readers who are familiar with the astronomical magnitude system of measuring brightness: an image taken at a standard distance corresponds to defining an absolute magnitude). \n\nThe second systematic error occurs whenever a part of a light source is obscured from the perspective of the observer. Street lights can be blocked by branches or leaves, or by dirt on the street light itself; astronomical objects can be situated behind clouds of gas and dust, leading to extinction phenomena. This systematic error will always make the source appear less bright; it should be investigated whenever a street light brightness measurement gives a value that is unexpectedly low, corresponding to a standard candle distance that is unexpectedly large. In some cases, the obscuration can be found out and documented, or even corrected for. In the worked-out example, an image taken at greater magnification showed leaves obscuring part of a street light that had been measured as surprisingly dim. From the zoomed-in image, the fraction of obscuration could be determined, and a corresponding brightness correction applied.

They are so distant that we see them as pinpoints even through big telescopes, while they really are big balls of gas like the Sun. They form constellations, and some of the brightest stars have their own names, e.g., Vega, Antares, and Sirius. Some stars have distinct colours, but most of them have only a hint of colours.\n\nA star\u2019s colour is related to its stellar spectral type, from bluer to redder, O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. The sequence is physically the sequence of stellar surface temperature, from hotter to cooler. The Sun is a type G star, white-yellow in colour. A pure white star is called type A. Planets are \u2018wandering\u2019(they wander through the background of stars) pinpoints of light and are siblings of Earth. While planets are much smaller than stars, they are close enough to observe as disk images through our telescopes. Some bright planets have distinct colours. The colour of the planet comes from its reflection of sunlight.\n\n**Twinkling [Related science field: Astronomical scintillation, Composition of atmosphere]**\n\nOne reason for the twinkling of stars and planets is the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Many layers of air of slightly different refraction indices flow through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As the starlight passes through the atmosphere, it bends, thus causing the twinkling. Since planets are small disk images in our sky, the bent light from each point combines, minimising the twinkling. Since stars are pinpoints, they twinkle more than planets. Not only does the position of the pinpoint dance around but the colour of the pinpoint also seems to change a little, especially for white stars. The degree of a star\u2019s twinkling varies daily with the weather conditions.\n\n**Diurnal motion [Related science fields: Earth rotation, Sun-Earth system]**\n\nAll the stars, planets, and the Sun and the Moon move once a day across the sky. This apparent motion of diurnal motion is due to Earth\u2019s rotation on its axis once a day. All the heavenly bodies rise from the eastern horizon, soar high, and set to the western horizon, except objects close to Polaris, the North Star, which circle around the celestial north pole. The diurnal motion is slow, so when the body is about to set it is a good chance to observe the continuous motion that is common to all bodies.\n\n**Colour of the evening sky [Related science fields: Sun-Earth system, Composition of atmosphere, Scattering of light]**\n\nThe sunlight that strikes Earth\u2019s atmosphere scatters, creating a bright blue sky in the day time, and various colours in the evening sky. The colours of the evening sky change by the day depending on the weather conditions. The colour is also affected by small particles in the air.\n\n**First star [Related science fields: Solar system, Season, Latitude and longitude, Time of the day]**\n\nThe first star is not a specific star or planet. It could sometimes be a planet like Venus or Jupiter or a star like Vega or Sirius. Planetarium software like Stellarium or almanacs are of use to learn the names and positions of planets and stars. The time when night falls and the first star is visible depends on the season, latitude, and longitude of the observing site.\n\n**CAUTION:** Staring at the Sun, even the setting Sun, is very dangerous for our eyes.

This activity is a children-educator, conversation-based activity.\n\n--- Choose one or several of the activities described below. ---\n\n###Activity 1: Evening Sky Painting after Sunset\n\n**Activity 1.1 Colour of the evening sky**\n\nObservation: Evening sky\n\n- Question: What colour is the sky?\n- Expected answer: Red or orange\n- Question: Is that the only colour you see? What else?\n- Expected answer: Golden yellow, blue, dark blue, grey\u2026\n\nQuestion-and-answer stimulates further observation. Teachers also may notice a wide variety of colours. Finding many colours leads to a richer drawing activity. Be careful as intense sunlight can cause severe damage to the eyes. Even the gentle light of the setting Sun can be very dangerous to stare at. After sunset is a good time for observations.\n\n**Activity 1.2 Colours of the evening sky in different directions**\n\nObservation: Evening sky\n\n- Question: Is the colour the same across the sky all day?\n- Expected answer: It is red and orange and yellow in the evening.\n- Question: Look above your head.\n- Expected answer: Ah, it is dark blue!\n- Question: Look in the direction opposite to sunset.\n- Expected answer: Ah, it is a little bright, too.\n- Question: What colour is it?\n- Expected answer: There is an area that is somewhat pink.\n\nQuestion-and-answer stimulates further observation. Different from the daytime sky, the colour of the evening sky differs a lot from horizon to zenith, from east to west. Lie on the playground and you will notice the variation. You may notice a strange pink horizontal belt parallel to the eastern horizon. The dark area below the pink belt just above the eastern horizon is the shadow the Earth casts on Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The pink belt is the edge of the Earth\u2019s shadow and it is the projection of the evening glow. The pink belt is called the Venus belt.\n\n**Activity 1.3 Colour change of the evening sky**\n\nObservation: Evening sky\n\n- Question: Is the colour of the sky changing?\n- Expected answer: Yes.\n- Question: In what way? \n- Expected answer: The sky is getting dark, from blue to dark blue to black. The yellow and orange part is getting smaller.\n- Question: How about the whole sky? \n- Expected answer: The bright area is sinking down and down.\n\nQuestion-and-answer stimulates further observations.\n\n**Activity 1.4 The shape and colour of the evening clouds**\n\nObservation: Evening sky\n\n- Question: Pick out your favourite cloud shapes. What are they?\n- Expected answer: A dog! A cat! A dinosaur! A dragon! A ghost!\n\nSome may be real animals or buildings and others may be imaginary ones. Finding many strange features will lead to a richer drawing activity.\n\n- Question: Are the clouds moving?\n- Expected answer: The clouds are floating.\n- Question: Look at the clouds for a while.\n- Expected answer: The clouds are moving! The cloud shapes are changing!\n\nQuestion-and-answer stimulates further observations. Some students do not care about clouds moving or their changing shapes, so they often draw stereotypical clouds as pretty cotton on the upper part of the sheet. Do not just tell the students that clouds are not still, encourage the students to notice they are not.\n\nStudents may say that some clouds are black. This is not due to their true colour, but the bottom of the clouds are in the shade. Teachers can explain it like this: if the outside is bright, switch off the room light and look at the white window frame. It looks black compared to the bright outside landscape, though the true colour is white (or another colour).\n\n**Activity 1.5 The changes in temperature, wind, sound and atmosphere**\n\nObservation: Temperature, wind, sound\n\n- Question: Do you feel something different in the evening?\n- Expected answer: It is getting dark.\n- Question: Is that all you feel? Is it cold? Is it dark? How about sound? How about wind?\n- Expected answer: The temperature is getting cold suddenly. Many people are going home so traffic noise is increasing. The wind is getting stronger and the direction may change.\n\nQuestion-and-answer stimulates further observations. Let students feel that astronomical phenomenon like the Sun setting has a great impact on our daily life.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/fb5749c1-8953-4336-86c5-551cf9518275/astroedu1616_evening_sky.jpg)\nIn the evening sky there are pinpoints of light other than stars. Some clouds and buildings look black due to shade, hiding their true colours.\n\n###Activity 2: First Star\n\n**Activity 2.1 Picking out the first star**\n\nObservation: First star\n\n- Question: It is getting dark. Look for and find the first star.\n- Expected answer: There it is!\n\nStudent eyesight is better than that of adults, especially in the evening. Even though an astronomy educator knows where the first star will pop up, the students can win.\n\n- Question: (Though a girl or a boy may find the first star quickly, many others may not.) She (or he) found it! (To another student) Not yet? Please explain the position.\n- Expected answer: Above that tree. To the left of the lamp. \u2013 No! \u2013 Two fists above the tree, a little left of the lamp, just on the edge of the dog-shaped cloud. \u2013 Yes, there!\n\nEncourage students to explain the position of the first star by indicating other objects and the distances from them. Some students would ask about star names. However, you do not have to remember all the names. Observing stars popping up and colours and explaining them clearly are more important for students to improve their scientific skills than just knowing the names. Therefore, encourage students to notice the star's position and colour and other characteristics carefully. On the other hand, learning a star's name in advance is good for the educator's confidence. Software such as Stellarium is very useful for learning the sunset time, twilight duration, and names of bright stars depending on the location, latitude, longitude, and date. The software also simulates how the first and several other stars will pop up.\n\n**Activity 2.2 Picking out the second and third stars**\n\nObservation: A few bright stars\n\n- Question: Have you all already found the first star?\n- Expected answer: Yes!\n- Question: Where is it?\n- Expected answer: There! (Pointing with a finger)\n- Question: Mm? Some are pointing there and others are pointing there\u2026 Are there \u201cmany\u201d first stars?\n- Expected answer: That is the first star! \u2013 No, that is the first star! \u2013 Yes, I think so! \u2013 No, that is true!\n\nWhen students find the first star, it is already very dark. As the second, third and many more stars pop up, they will notice how many stars there are in the evening sky even in an urban area. One cannot expect to see a sky full of stars with the Milky Way in an urban area, but several bright pinpoints of light are enough for students to feel that there is a real starry sky in their daily life.\n\n- Question: OK, can you count the number of stars?\n- Expected answer: Yes! One, two\u2026\n\nFor very young students, counting over ten may be a little difficult, but if there is a need to count, we need big numbers. There is no intention to make them learn math too early. We have to count, so we need big numbers, and students enjoy using big numbers.\n\n- Question: Now, how do you tell stars apart from airplanes or helicopters?\n- Expected answer: Stars shine steadily. Airplanes shine on and off. Artificial satellites grow brighter or fainter. / Stars don\u2019t move. Airplanes do. Artificial satellites move fast. / The colour is different. (Stars are not so colourful.) / Stars do not make a sound. \n\nBased on what they see in their daily lives, students can successfully distinguish stars from other objects. Here, it is important to let them explain the reason. Students will try to explain using words or gestures.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/fb5749c1-8953-4336-86c5-551cf9518275/astroedu1616_planet_venus.jpg)\nThis is an example of the first star, planet Venus with some small eerie clouds.\n\n###Activity 3: Stars\n\n**Activity 3.1 The colours of stars**\n\nObservation: A few bright stars\n\n- Question: Do you notice the colours of the stars?\n- Expected answer: \u2026No. / Colours?\n- Question: You may feel many stars look white. But there is a hint of colour, a little red, a little blue. Can you see the hint?\n- Expected answer: Yes, I see some red\u2026 / A little blue!\n\nQuestion-and-answer stimulates further observation. A star\u2019s colour is subtle. There are no colourful pure red or pure blue stars. Basically they are white with a hint of red, orange, yellow, or blue. Human eyesight is poor at distinguishing the colours of less bright objects. If we use binoculars or telescopes and get a lot of light, we can enjoy a variety of star colours, but with simply the naked eye, only some of the brightest stars show any colour. Science books introduce the colours of stars, and some planetariums project exaggerated colours. But the reality is that a star\u2019s colour is subtle and not easy to see.\n\n- Question: Is that star orange? Is that true? Is that star white with no colour? Is that true? Look at it again carefully.\n- Expected answer: Wow, the colour changes! Yellow? No! Now, it is blue\u2026 No! I can\u2019t figure out the colour!\n\nQuestion-and-answer stimulates further observations. Due to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, stars twinkle. That also causes a flickering change of the colours. The best examples are Vega in summer and Sirius in winter. Both are spectral A type stars, and the expected colour is pure white. However, through the twinkling, the colour seems to change from red, yellow, and blue to white. Enjoy the flickering colour as well as the flickering light. Flickering colour cannot be simulated in a planetarium dome. It is a sign of true natural star light.\n\n**Activity 3.2 A star\u2019s motion  (recommended age range: C)**\n\nObservation: A few stars, especially a setting bright star or planet\n\n- Question: Do stars set?\n- Expected answer: No! Stars float.\n- Question: Does the Sun set?\n- Expected answer: Yes.\n- Question: Why do you think so?\n- Expected answer: I saw it.\n- Question: Good. Then, does the Moon set?\n- Expected answer: Yes. I saw it.\n- Question: Good. Then, why do you think stars don\u2019t set?\n- Expected answer: I didn\u2019t see it. Stars pop up and float in the night.\n\nThis is a typical question-and-answer of a 4 or 5-year-old child. They answer yes or no based on what they see in their daily life. It is a scientific attitude. Most students have not seen stars setting or rising. The situation is the same for most adults.\n\n- Question: Do you know there is a bright star in the evening twilight? (If you can see Venus or Jupiter, take advantage of the lucky situation.)\n- Expected answer: I know. Every day I go home with dad from the nursery, and I see the star!\n- Question: Good. Does the star stand still? Does it move?\n- Expected answer: \u2026 / Sometime, it changes position.\n- Question: After going home, with adults, look at the star from a window for a while. Today will be clear. Try it!\n\nThe motion of stars, which soar high above, is difficult to notice, but for stars that are about to set it is a lot easier to discern their motion. With solid experience, he or she will surely say: Stars set, stars move. Because I saw it. When stars are close to layers of clouds, and the clouds flow fast, the stars appear to move fast. If so, ask them \u2018Which one is moving, cloud or star?\u2019 Students would answer \u2018star, moving fast\u2019. \u2018Compare the star's position with respect to the trees and building. So fast?\u2019 Students will learn that it is important to have multiple reference points.\n", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS1 | Science | - | Working scientifically: using their observations and ideas to suggest answers to questions.\nUK | Early Years Foundation Scheme | Communication and language  | - | Listening and attention: children listen attentively in a range of situations.

Le distanze nel nostro Sistema Solare sono molto grandi se comparate con le dimensioni dei pianeti. Ci vogliono pi\u00f9 di 10.000 Terre per coprire la distanza tra la Terra e il Sole. (Il diametro del Sole corrisponde a pi\u00f9 di 100 volte quello della Terra e ci vogliono pi\u00f9 di 100 Soli per coprire la distanza Terra-Sole)\nGli astronomi chiamano questa distanza Unit\u00e0 Astronomica. E, ancora, ci vogliono circa 3.300 terre per coprire la distanza tra noi e Venere mentre ce ne vogliono 6.100 per coprire quella tra noi e Marte. E questo vale solo quando i pianeti sono tra loro pi\u00f9 vicini nella loro orbita perch\u00e9 di solito i \u201cnostri vicini\u201d sono molto pi\u00f9 lontani. Anche considerando il corpo celeste a noi pi\u00f9 vicino, la Luna, bisogna attraversare 30 Terre messe in fila per arrivarci! Queste distanze fanno si che il nostro pianeta appaia molto piccolo se visto dagli altri pianeti. \n\nLa Terra \u00e8 una sfera limitata nelle sue dimensioni cos\u00ec come limitate sono le risorse che possono essere sfruttate dal genere umano. L\u2019atmosfera terrestre \u00e8 molto piccola e sottile se confrontata con il diametro del pianeta. Se la Terra fosse grande come una mela, l\u2019atmosfera risulterebbe pi\u00f9 sottile della sua buccia. Gli esseri umani possono facilmente alterare la composizione di questa piccola atmosfera. Se vengono immessi troppi gas in essa, la Terra si riscalda a causa di un aumento dell\u2019effetto serra. Ci\u00f2 pu\u00f2 avere conseguenze drammatiche per noi, come l\u2019innalzamento dei mari, la desertificazione, i mutamenti climatici e un ulteriore effetto di aumento della temperatura con un riscaldamento globale. Senza altre civilt\u00e0 aliene vicine che possano aiutarci n\u00e9 con pianeti abitabili raggiungibili noi dipendiamo dalla Terra. \n\n####Cittadinanza globale \n\nUno dei principali obiettivi del progetto educativo Universe Awareness (UNAWE) \u00e8 dare ai bambini il senso di cittadinanza globale. Noi tutti viviamo in questo piccolo pallino azzurro che fluttua nel vasto spazio vuoto. Quando si ha a che fare con grandezze estreme come le dimensioni dei pianeti, delle stelle, e dell\u2019Universo in generale, la tua prospettiva si sposta da quella della piccola comunit\u00e0 locale dove vivi a quella pi\u00f9 ampia e globale dell\u2019umanit\u00e0 intera. Tutti su questo pianeta vediamo la stessa Luna e lo stesso Sole nello stesso cielo. Avere a che fare con l\u2019Astronomia \u00e8 un\u2019esperienza identica per ogni essere umano. Il realizzare che noi condividiamo tutti questa unica piccola sfera come casa ci lega in quanto specie e ci fa pensare a quanto potremmo lavorare tutti insieme per apprezzare l\u2019unico paradiso nello spazio che abbiamo. \n\nQuesto video incorpora il messaggio che UnAwe vuole promuovere. Quando gli astronauti andarono nello spazio per la prima volta all\u2019inizio degli anni 60 e guardarono la Terra, essi videro qualcosa che nessun uomo aveva mai visto prima di loro: la Terra fluttuante nello spazio \u201cvuoto\u201d, una luminosa pallina blu, che si stagliava nell\u2019oscurit\u00e0 su uno sfondo infinito. Questi astronauti provarono un vero senso di cittadinanza globale chiamato \u201coverview effect\u201d*. Essi furono in grado di comunicare il messaggio di UnAwe come nessun altro, usando il video della Terra vista dallo Spazio.\n\n####L'Overview Effect\nDescritto per la prima volta dallo scrittore Frank White nel 1987, \u00e8 l\u2019esperienza che trasforma la prospettiva degli astronauti nei confronti del pianeta e quindi del luogo che accoglie il genere umano. \n\nCaratteristiche comuni di questa esperienza sono un sentimento di timore per il pianeta, una profonda comprensione dell\u2019interconnessione di tutta la vita, e un rinnovato senso di responsabilit\u00e0 per la cura dell\u2019ambiente.\n\n####La Stazione Spaziale Internazionale \n\nCon l\u2019avanzamento tecnologico legato alla fotografia, gli astronauti oggi riescono a realizzare filmati della Terra vista dalla ISS durante  la loro orbita attorno al pianeta ogni 90 minuti. Questo filmato mostra il nostro pianeta con un dettaglio eccezionale e ci mostra un mondo fiorente e senza confini. \nCosmologia \nCome specie noi non condividiamo solo il nostro pianeta natale ma anche un\u2019unica Storia. Naturalmente ogni cultura ha il suo proprio background ma l\u2019Umanit\u00e0 nel suo complesso ha un\u2019unica \u201cstoria cosmica\u201d. La cosmologia ci racconta la storia dell\u2019Universo dal suo inizio fino al momento in cui stelle e piaenti si sono formati. Questa storia ci dice che gli esseri umani, quale che siano il loro colore della pelle o cultura, sono fatti tutti della stessa sostanza: polvere di stelle. Pensa per esempio a tutte le persone del mondo: la cosa bizzarra \u00e8 che dentro di te ci sono atomi che una volta furono all'interno di altre persone!\n", "fulldesc": "###Passo 1\nMostrare agli studenti il video filmato dalla ISS nella sua orbita attorno alla Terra ogni 90 minuti, dove si riprende la superficie del pianeta da una altezza di 370 chilometri. \n\n###Passo 2\nChiedere agli studenti se riescono a identificare l\u2019atmosfera terrestre. Enfatizzare quanto sottile e vulnerabile essa sia in confronto alle dimensioni della Terra. Se la Terra fosse una mela l\u2019atmosfera sarebbe molto pi\u00f9 sottile della sua buccia. Chiedere loro cos\u2019altro vedono. \n\n###Passo 3\nGli studenti hanno ora una prima visione della Terra, sebbene non l\u2019abbiano ancora vista come una sfera che fluttua nello spazio (per questo mostrare loro l\u2019immagine \u201cEarth from Space\u201d). Spiegare come il confine tra giorno e notte si sposti da Est a Ovest (da destra a sinistra) attraverso la superficie terrestre. La Terra ruota attorno al suo asse in direzione Est \u2013 antioraria, se la si guarda dallo spazio sopra il Polo Nord, e pensando al Sole come una luce fissa di background. Se invece la si guarda da sopra il Polo Sud, la terra ruota in senso orario (sempre in direzione Est).\n\n###Passo 4\nOra compiamo un viaggio ancora pi\u00f9 in l\u00e0, verso la Luna. Mostrate agli studenti l\u2019immagine \u201cEarthrise\u201d (una fotografia ripresa dagli astronauti della missione Apollo 8 nel 1968). Questi astronauti sono stati i primi esseri umani a orbitare attorno a un corpo celeste diverso dalla Terra e quando essi si guardano indietro verso il loro pianeta natale, essi fecero l\u2019esperienza che va sotto il nome di \u201coverview effect\u201d: tutto quello che essi amavano e conoscevano era su di una piccola biglia blu sospesa pacificamente nello spazio. \n\n###Passo 5\nA questo punto \u00e8 possibile passare dalle fotografie ai modellini. Prendere la palla che rappresenta la Terra (il pallone o mappamondo gonfiabile di 40 cm di diametro) e far tenere a un volontario la pallina di polistirolo da 10 cm (o in mancanza di questa un\u2019arancia). Usare sempre la stessa scala di dimensioni: se per esempio avete un pallone di 20 cm per rappresentare la Terra allora usate una pallina di 5 cm per la Luna, e cos\u00ec via\u2026\n\n###Passo 6\nChiedere al volontario che tiene in mano il modellino che rappresenta la Luna di porsi alla distanza che lui/lei ritiene corretta in accordo con la scala delle dimensioni utilizzata. \n\n###Passo 7\nChiedere agli altri studenti se sono d\u2019accordo sulla distanza che compagno e se non lo sono farli disporre alla distanza che loro ritengono corretta. La risposta corretta \u00e8 quella di porsi a una distasnza pari a 30 volte il diametro della palla che rappresenta la Terra. Se abbiamo usato quella da 40 cm avremmo 12 metri. Lasciare che gli studenti si dispongano a tale distanza, anche se \u00e8 fuori dalla stanza, e dire loro che quella \u00e8 la dimensione con cui vedrebbero la Terra se la guardassero dalla Luna. \n\n###Passo 8\nProcediamo nel nostro viaggio virtuale verso i pianeti esterni. Chiedere agli studenti di restare in fondo alla classe. Ora tenere in mano la sferetta da 0,25 cm di diametro, come il grano di pepe. Gli studenti stanno guardando la Terra come la vedrebbero da Marte quando il pianeta rosso si trova alla minima distanza dalla Terra! \n\n###Passo 9\nMostrare agli studenti l\u2019immagine 'Pale Blue Dot' che \u00e8 stata scattata dalla sonda Voyager 1, inviata nello spazio nel 1977 e che ha ora gi\u00e0 passato l\u2019orbita di Nettuno, il pianeta pi\u00f9 esterno del Sistema Solare. Naturalmente la Voyager 1 non ha equipaggio umano a bordo, infatti nessun essere umano ha viaggiato nello spazio oltre l\u2019orbita della Luna. Nell\u2019immagine si vede proprio un pallido puntino blu. Questo \u00e8 come appare la Terra vista da una distanza di 6 miliardi di chilometri che \u00e8 la distanza media di Plutone. Ci vogliono quasi mezzo milione di Terre messe in fila per coprire una tale distanza. Un aeroplano, se potesse volare nello spazio interplanetario, ci impiegherebbe 600 anni! Le righe nell\u2019immagine sono dovute al \u201crumore\u201d cio\u00e8 al disturbo. \n\n###Passo 10\nChiedere agli studenti se \u00e8 cambiata la loro prospettiva sulla Terra. Pensano ancora che la Terra sia sufficientemente grande da soddisfare l\u2019umanit\u00e0 con risorse inesauribili? Spiegare loro che la Terra \u00e8 una sfera dai confini limitati e con risorse limitate. Se noi inquiniamo il nostro pianeta non c\u2019\u00e8 nessuno nello Spazio che pu\u00f2 aiutarci a risolvere il problema. Non abbiamo un altro posto dove andare. La terra \u00e8 l\u2019unica casa che abbiamo. \nNota: per gli studenti dai 9 ai 10 anni si pu\u00f2 estendere l\u2019argomento alla ricerca di vita sugli esopianeti, che sono i pianeti fuori dal nostro Sistema Solare. Finora sono circa 2.000 gli esopianeti rilevati con certezza. Da questa attivit\u00e0 gli studenti hanno imparato quanto appaia piccola la Terra vista dall\u2019esterno del Sistema Solare. E se torniamo sulla terra si comprende quanto piccoli siano gli esopianeti e quindi quanto difficili da rilevare. Per questo \u00e8 difficile determinare se la vita si sia potuta sviluppare o meno su essi. Anche con i pi\u00f9 potenti strumenti \u00e8 gi\u00e0 difficile vedere i pianeti figuriamoci se riusciamo a fare lo zoom per osservare anche eventuali organismi viventi. \nTuttavia vi sono diversi metodi per esaminare gli esopianeti. \nChiedere agli studenti di pensare a dei modi per trovare pianeti che possano ospitare la vita o dei modi per rilevare tracce di vita. Una delle cose indispensabili \u00e8 che il pianeta abbia acqua liquida. Esso dovrebbe essere inoltre sufficientemente lontano dalla stella madre per mantenere l\u2019acqua sulla superficie senza che evapori. E allo stesso tempo dovrebbe essere non troppo lontana perch\u00e9 non sia tutta completamente ghiacciata. Anche un\u2019atmosfera \u00e8 necessaria per proteggere le forme di vita dalla radiazione dannosa e dalle grandi variazioni di temperatura. Nel Futuro gli astronomia potrebbero sviluppare dei telescopi cos\u00ec potenti da rilevare, per esempio, il colore dei pianeti dal quale dedurre se esso ha o no vegetazione. \nFino ad oggi non abbiamo ancora trovato un pianeta simile alla Terra. Se lo trovassimo \u00e8 sicuramente molto lontano da essere difficile studiarlo con i mezzi a nostra disposizione.

Nel corso degli ultimi 3,7 miliardi di anni, la vita sulla Terra si \u00e8 adattata a quasi ogni ambiente immaginabile. Ma cosa rende la Terra cos\u00ec perfettamente adatta a sostenere la vita?\n\n####Distanza dal Sole\nLa Terra si trova nella \u201czona abitabile\u201d del nostro Sistema Solare, che \u00e8 la stretta banda all\u2019interno della quale pu\u00f2 esistere l\u2019acqua liquida. Se la Terra fosse pi\u00f9 vicina al Sole, i suoi oceani evaporerebbero, impedendo l\u2019esistenza della vita cos\u00ec come la conosciamo. Se il nostro pianeta orbitasse pi\u00f9 lontano dal Sole, gli oceani congelerebbero e il ciclo dell\u2019acqua che permette la vita sarebbe inesistente.\n\nLa \u201czona abitabile\u201d non \u00e8 limitata al nostro Sistema Solare: \u00e8 l\u2019area intorno a ogni stella dove la temperatura \u00e8 \u201cquella giusta\u201d per l\u2019esistenza di acqua allo stato liquido. Queste zone non sono cos\u00ec fredde da farla ghiacciare o cos\u00ec calde da farla bollire. Per le stelle pi\u00f9 calde, la zona abitabile \u00e8 pi\u00f9 lontana dalla stella, mentre per quelle pi\u00f9 fredde \u00e8 pi\u00f9 vicina.\n\n####Acqua\nL\u2019acqua \u00e8 essenziale per la vita? Sulla Terra dobbiamo ancora scoprire un organismo che non necessita dell\u2019acqua per sopravvivere. L'acqua agisce sia come solvente sia come meccanismo di distribuzione, sciogliendo le vitamine essenziali e i nutrimenti dal cibo e consegnandoli alle cellule. I nostri corpi utilizzano l\u2019acqua anche per espellere le tossine, regolare la temperatura corporea e aiutare il nostro metabolismo. Nessuna meraviglia, quindi, che l\u2019acqua costituisca circa il 60% dei nostri corpi e che non possiamo farne a meno per pi\u00f9 di pochi giorni. \n\nL\u2019acqua sostiene la vita anche in altri modi: la utilizziamo per le coltivazioni, mantenere il bestiame, lavare il nostro cibo (o i nostri corpi). Anche gli oceani della Terra aiutano a regolare il clima del pianeta, assorbendo il calore in estate e rilasciandolo durante l\u2019inverno. Inoltre quegli stessi oceani servono da casa per innumerevoli piante e animali.\n\nComunque non abbiamo sufficienti informazioni per dire se la vita potrebbe esistere senza l\u2019acqua. Sappiamo per certo che la vita sulla Terra non potrebbe.\n\n####Gravit\u00e0\nLa gravit\u00e0 tiene legate alla superfice della Terra sia le cose viventi sia quelle non viventi e impedisce loro di volare via nello spazio. Trattiene anche la nostra atmosfera, impedendole di disperdersi nello spazio. \n\nMolti mondi nel Sistema Solare sono pi\u00f9 piccoli della Terra (in raggio e massa) e hanno una gravit\u00e0 inferiore. Quindi, gli oggetti sono \u201cpi\u00f9 leggeri\u201d in questi mondi. Altri pianeti sono pi\u00f9 grandi della Terra (in raggio e massa) e hanno una gravit\u00e0 maggiore, che pu\u00f2 avere un grande effetto sull\u2019ambiente di questi mondi: per esempio, la pressione sulla superficie di un gigante gassoso \u00e8 cos\u00ec intensa che qualunque forma di vita sarebbe schiacciata in pochi secondi.\n\n####Atmosfera\nL\u2019atmosfera terrestre ha il giusto spessore per sostenere la vita. Senza atmosfera non saremmo in grado di respirare. Lo spazio \u00e8 un vuoto senza aria in cui ogni forma di vita verrebbe soffocata velocemente. La coperta della nostra atmosfera regola, poi, la temperatura della superficie mantenendo lontano il freddo congelante dello spazio durante la notte e il caldo furioso del Sole durante il giorno. L\u2019atmosfera agisce anche come barriera protettiva che assorbe la radiazione solare pi\u00f9 nociva, i raggi cosmici e altri corpi, prima che raggiungano la superficie.\n\nLa composizione dell\u2019atmosfera terrestre \u00e8 anche molto importante per la vita. Alcuni dei gas agiscono come una serra, mantenendo il calore in superficie. D\u2019altra parte se questi cosiddetti \u201cgas serra\u201d diventano troppo abbondanti, per cause naturali o artificiali, il pianeta potrebbe riscaldarsi troppo e diventare inabitabile per molte forme di vita.\n\nNon abbiamo evidenze che la vita extraterrestre sarebbe limitata dalle stesse condizioni ambientali presenti sulla Terra. Altre forme di vita, infatti, possono non necessitare dell\u2019acqua, dell\u2019ossigeno o anche di una superficie solida per prosperare; comunque, come la vita sulla Terra, anch'essi dovrebbero adattarsi al loro ambiente per sopravvivere.\n", "fulldesc": "La ricerca di vita extra-terrestre \u00e8 indubbiamente uno degli argomenti scientifici pi\u00f9 attraenti e interessanti, in particolare per i bambini. Le osservazioni astronomiche suggeriscono che gran parte delle stelle simili al Sole posseggano un proprio sistema planetario: l\u2019idea di vita extraterrestre appare dunque sempre pi\u00f9 realistica. \nQuesta attivit\u00e0 utilizza il tema della vita aliena per mostrare come si possano affrontare in modo scientifico argomenti emozionante e di frontiera e che le opportunit\u00e0 per ulteriori scoperte in astronomia sono quasi infinite, come l\u2019universo.\n \nNel seguito, ci occuperemo sia dei mondi extraterrestri sia del nostro pianeta, la Terra. Educando i bambini alle condizioni essenziali per la vita qui sulla Terra e confrontandole con quelle sugli altri mondi, essi imparano che questo \u00e8 il solo posto nell\u2019universo che \u00e8 in grado di sostenere la vita come la conosciamo, il che promuove il rispetto per l\u2019ambiente e un senso di comunit\u00e0 globale.\n \n####Peparazione \n- stampate le immagini del Sistema Solare (Terra, Marte, Mercurio, Giove, Io e Titano);\n- Preparte il computer, il proiettore e il copione per la presentazione \u201cProgetta il tuo Alieno\u201d\n- stampate la scheda dell'Alieno marziano\n\n### Passo 1\n- Dividere gli studenti in gruppi di almeno 4 componenti.

These include eight planets and various secondary bodies, dwarf planets and small Solar System objects that orbit the Sun directly, as well as satellites (moons) that orbit many planets and smaller objects. The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, also called the terrestrial planets, are primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets, called the gas giants, are substantially bigger than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. The two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are composed largely of substances with relatively high melting points (compared with hydrogen and helium), called ices, such as water, ammonia and methane, and are often referred to separately as \u2018ice giants\u2019. All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic plane.\n\nA solar system refers to a star and all the objects that travel in orbit around it. Our Solar System consists of the Sun - our star - eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon); dwarf planets; asteroids and comets. Our Solar System is located in an outward spiral of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\n**CCD astro-imaging:**\n\nA charge-coupled device (CCD) is an electronic instrument for detecting light. In the case of an astronomical CCD camera, this light is very dim. This has certain implications on how the CCD operates.\nA CCD uses a thin silicon wafer chip. The chip is divided into thousands or millions of tiny light sensitive squares (or sometimes rectangles) called photosites. Each photosite corresponds to an individual pixel in the final image, and the photosites are often referred to simply as pixels. For clarity in this discussion, \u2018photosites\u2019 will refer to the CCD chip and \u2018pixels\u2019 will refer to an image. Each photosite is surrounded by a non-conductive boundary, which contains the charge that is collected during an exposure.\n\n**Parallax:**\n\nParallax is a method of measuring the distance to an object. Just like how our binocular vision helps us determine distance, the direction to a distant point is slightly different from two separate observation positions. When observing a distant object at exactly the same time from two separated places, if the distance between the observation positions is known, and the angle between them can be measured, with the help of simple geometry, the distance to the object can be calculated. In practice, given that in most astronomical applications, the parallax angle is very small, the only way to take advantage of this technique for distance determination is by means of a very large baseline.\n\n**Diurnal Parallax Effect:**\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/f7cdcad1-ea62-4325-b638-773e9663c28f/diurnal_fig1.png)\n**Figure 1.** Geometry of the diurnal parallax effect. As the Earth rotates, any observer on its surface sees the target\u2019s parallactic angle \u03c6 constantly varying, from a maximum value occurring when his Meridian is at right angle to the plane containing the Earth\u2019s rotation axis and the target (some 6 hours prior or after transit time) to a\nnull value whenever the target happens to be placed on his Meridian (target culmination). \n\nPlaced on the Earth\u2019s surface, any observer actually moves along a perfectly circular track, several thousand kilometres in radius, making one complete circle each 23.93 hours \u2013 the sidereal period. At any given time, the observer is seeing the vault of heaven from a slightly different and continuously changing perspective compared to a fictitious observer placed at rest at the centre of the Earth. The apparent varying displacement of relatively nearby celestial objects with respect to distant \u2018fixed\u2019 stars as observed from any ground site, exclusively due to the Earth\u2019s daily rotation, is known as the diurnal parallax effect. This effect materializes as a very subtle angular oscillation, ranging from a few hundreds of arcseconds for sufficiently close near-Earth objects (NEOs) to barely tenths of arcseconds for the furthest observable Solar System objects. The diurnal parallax effect is immeasurably small for celestial bodies beyond the Solar System.\n\nThe diurnal parallax effect has nothing to do with the fact that any given Solar System object is moving with respect to the centre of the Earth. Comparatively, the apparent celestial motion of any Solar System body due to its orbital revolution around the Sun becomes orders of magnitude larger than its corresponding diurnal parallax effect. Therefore, the measurement of diurnal parallax must not only deal with minute oscillating displacements with respect to \u2018fixed\u2019 stars, but at the same time such tiny effects are always encapsulated within much larger \u2018proper motion\u2019 displacements across the sky. Consequently, the first step in the diurnal parallax game requires accurately subtracting the dominant orbital trajectory across the sky from the actually observed apparent celestial motion of the target in question. If carefully and properly done, what remains after this sieving \u2013 usually referred to as \u2018residuals\u2019 \u2013 is only due to the diurnal parallax effect.\n\nAssuming that for a time period as short as a couple of days the distance from the Earth\u2019s centre to the target is basically constant \u2013 a generally appropriate assumption except for nearby NEO asteroids and the Moon \u2013 the time variability of the parallactic angle can be exclusively attributed to the observer\u2019s changing position relative to a fixed direction in the equatorial plane. In other words, with respect to the plane that contains the axis of rotation of the Earth (i.e. in declination), the parallax angle remains basically invariant. This is why the diurnal parallax is also called the east-west parallax.\n\nThe diurnal parallax effect exactly corresponds to the variable parallactic angle \u2013 the angle that at any given moment is formed by the target at the vertex, the observer on one side and the centre of the Earth on the other side \u2013 projected to the equatorial plane. It\u2019s clear that at the moment of the target\u2019s culmination (when the target happens to be on the observer\u2019s meridian), the variable diurnal parallax angle becomes null, while achieving its maximum theoretical value some 5.98 hours (\u00bc of sidereal period) either before or after transit. (It would be at exactly \u00bc of the sidereal period if the target were not moving with respect to Earth\u2019s centre.)\n\nTherefore, by definition, at any given time t, the variable diurnal parallax angle \u03c6 (t) becomes\n\n\u03c6 (t) = [RAtopo (t) \u2212 RAgeo (t)] cos \u03b4 (t)\t\t\t\t\t\t(1)\n\nwhere RAtopo(t) is the object\u2019s topocentric (measured from the observer location) right ascension at the considered moment, RAgeo(t) is the object\u2019s geocentric (measured from the centre of the Earth) right ascension at the same considered moment and \u03b4(t) is the object\u2019s declination also at the same moment (assumed to be practically the same as measured either from the observer\u2019s place or from the centre of the Earth).\n\nFor observations taken before transit, the parallactic projection of the target on the background star field makes it appear to the observer as displaced towards the east with respect to what would be observed at the same time from Earth\u2019s centre \u2013 that is, before transit: RAtopo(t) > RAgeo(t). Conversely, the parallactic projection appears displaced towards the west for observations that take place after transit \u2013 that is, after transit: RAtopo(t) < RAgeo(t). Therefore, as the Earth rotates, the term RAtopo(t) \u2013 RAgeo(t) inside the square brackets continuosly varies as the observer is carried along by the Earth\u2019s rotation, making the variable diurnal parallax angle \u03c6(t) positive for observations taking place before transit, exactly zero at transit, and negative for observations taking place after the transit. Maximum diurnal parallax angles are theoretically reached whenever the observer and the target happen to be placed at right angles with respect to the Earth\u2019s centre.\n\nMeanwhile, taking into account that the target\u2019s declination does vary \u2013 gradually \u2013 with time but totally independent of the Earth\u2019s rotation, the term cos \u03b4(t) changes only slightly during a short time period of a few days. Therefore, the variable diurnal parallax angle basically varies on a daily basis as a sinusoidal function, which at any time equals RAtopo(t) \u2013 RAgeo(t) times the almost constant cosine of the target\u2019s declination, thus becoming:\n\n\u03c6 (t) = [RAtopo (t) \u2212 RAgeo (t)] cos \u03b4 (t) = \u03c6max sin (\u03c9 (T0 \u2013 t))\t\t(2)\n\nwhere \u03c6max is the maximum amplitude of the variable diurnal parallax angle for the considered day, \u03c9 is the angular sidereal rotation rate of the Earth and T0 is the moment of the target culmination for the considered day. Once \u03c6max is known, the distance D to the target can be readily obtained by making use of the small-angle approximation, thus becoming:\n\nD = RE cos \u03bb / \u03c6max \t\t\t\t\t\t\t                             (3)\n\nwhere RE is the radius of the Earth, and \u03bb is the latitude of the observer (D and RE have to be expressed in the same units, while \u03c6max has to be in radians).\n\nThe 4-Point Backyard Diurnal Parallax Method:\nThe 4-Point Backyard Diurnal Parallax Method is a straightforward procedure for determining the key value of \u03c6max from a single station, not requiring any data other than that strictly derived from direct observations. Just by using an amateur-level telescope and CCD on two consecutive nights, imaging continuously for 10 minutes twice each night \u2013 at the beginning and at culmination \u2013 one can determine \u03c6max accurately, and then use it to compute the distance to the object in question.\n\nThe four required data points are the object\u2019s topocentric right ascension measured on two consecutive nights, and corresponding times. On the first night, it should be measured at any time as far as possible from transit (RAtopo (t1)) and at exact transit time (RAtopo (T01)); on the second night, too, it should be measured at any time as far as possible from transit (RAtopo (t2)) and at exact transit time (RAtopo (T02). It doesn\u2019t matter whether the measurements taken in addition to transit each night have the same time difference or not. Therefore, the four required data points actually are four pairs such as:\nOn night #1: (1) RAtopo (t1) and corresponding t1; and (2) RAtopo (T01) and corresponding T01.\nOn night #2: (3) RAtopo (t2) and corresponding t2; and (4) RAtopo (T02) and corresponding T02.\n\nGiven that at the moment of transit, the object\u2019s topocentric and geocentric right ascension are exactly the same, a linear approximation for estimating at any other time the otherwise unknown RAgeo (t) can be readily obtained:\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/f7cdcad1-ea62-4325-b638-773e9663c28f/equautiontp.png) \t\t\t                     \n(4)\n\nThis linear approximation for RAgeo (t) helps determine the diurnal parallax angles \u03c6 (t1) and \u03c6 (t2) measured at times t1 and t2 far apart from transit on each night. On each night, the variation of the diurnal parallax angle can be represented by a sinusoidal curve that, besides becoming null at the transit time, happens to pass through the measured \u03c6 (t) point. Such sinusoidal curves are unique; therefore once such curves are found, the maximum amplitude of the variable diurnal parallax angle for that day (respectively, \u03c6max1 and \u03c6max2) is known. Considering that both \u03c6max1 and \u03c6max2 are derived from a linear approximation that necessarily makes one of them underestimated and the other overestimated (a happy circumstance duly explained in correspondent published papers), an accurate final \u03c6max value results from averaging them:\n\n\u03c6max   (\u03c6max1 + \u03c6max2)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(5)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/f7cdcad1-ea62-4325-b638-773e9663c28f/Fig2%20Opposition.png)\n**Figure 2:**  Opposition - The apparent motion in right ascension of a minor planet.

The instant speed continues to decrease until the loop is ended and direct motion reassumed.", "fulldesc": "###Step 1: Selecting an appropriate target\n\nStudents have to research asteroids appropriate for this project. Potential targets for this project are the main-belt asteroids that at the time of observations will be relatively close to opposition, appearing relatively high on the local eastern skies at dusk. Of those appropriate candidates, the brighter the better.\n\n###Step 2: Taking the required images on night 1\n\nIn order to improve accuracy, in practice the required 4 data points will be obtained not from just 4 single isolated observations but instead from 4 sets of images \u2013 2 sets on the first night, and another 2 sets on the following night. On each night, the first set will be obtained soon after dusk sky turns dark enough, and the second set around the target\u2019s transit time.\n\nStudents should have the telescope and the imaging system duly prepared at least 15-minute before dusk. That is, for the telescope, the students should ensure that it is properly polar aligned, its pointing position is accurately known and that the tracking system operates normally. With the imaging system, the students should check that the CCD camera is correctly connected to its hardware control, it has achieved and stabilized at the operating temperature, the imaging software is running normally, the carpet where the images are to be placed has been defined, and the proper name/number designation of each image to be captured has been set. For asteroid targets brighter than 14 magnitude, to be imaged by means of a 20-cm telescope using a decent tracking system, exposure times should not be longer than 30 sec, so that no autoguiding is actually required.\n\nThe next step is to get the accurate time. The easiest way to do it is by synchronizing the PC running internal-time to an Internet atomic-time provider.\n\nThe first task to do after the first bright stars appear on the sky is to focus the camera. A Bahtinov mask helps to do so in a simple and straightforward way.\n\nAfter having successfully focused the camera, the next step is to point the telescope to the target and place it around centre of the CCD frame. The easiest way to do it is by means of an accurate pointing system, just directing the telescope to slew to the target\u2019s equatorial coordinates.\n\nThe asteroid in question must be recognized within the CCD frame. The easiest way to do it is by taking an image and immediately running it on a software tool that automatically detects its astrometric position and photometric value. The first one will help ensure that the images have captured the target; the second one will ensure that the selected exposure time helps achieve a proper signal/noise ratio (for the required astrometric goal, a SNR as low as 20 will be enough). \n\nAfter verified the imaging requirements, now it\u2019s time to continuously image the asteroid target for about 10-12 minutes. There is no constraint on the exact time this set of images should be actually taken \u2013 although preferably it should be as far apart from the transit time as possible. This is the set of images from where the first data point of the required \u20184-Point\u2019 will be obtained after processing. After this set of images is taken, there is nothing more to do until about 30 minutes before the transit time.\n\nAt about 30 minutes before the target\u2019s transit time (i.e. when its right ascension exactly matches local sidereal time), it\u2019s time to once again prepare for the second set of images. The stepwise list is exactly the same as before.\n\nAfter verifying all the imaging requirements, it\u2019s time to continuously image the asteroid target for about 10-12 minutes around the transit time. In contrast to the first set, the imaging interval of this set has to inevitably match the transit time \u2013 that is, it is imperative that some images are taken prior to the transit time, and other images are taken after the transit time. This is the set of images from where the second data point of the required \u20184-Point\u2019 will be obtained after processing. After this set of images is taken, there is nothing more to do.\n\n###Step 3: Taking the required images on night 2\n\nOn the following night (\u2018Night 2\u2019), the activities to be performed are exactly the same as on \u2018Night 1\u2019. The asteroid target has to be continuously imaged for about 10-12 minutes as far apart from the transit time as possible, and for about another 10-12 minutes around the transit time. These sets of images will be the sources for the third and fourth data points of the required \u20184-Point\u2019.\n\n###Step 4: Processing images and acquiring the required data\n\nStudents have to process the captured images by performing due reduction and astrometry. By applying a proper astrometric software tool to each taken image, the corresponding target\u2019s topocentric right ascension can be obtained (one value per image). After discarding any suspiciously wrong value, the four topocentric right ascension data points can be determined by averaging the obtained topocentric right ascension values corresponding to each set of images.\n\nOnce the required four topocentric right ascension values are obtained, all that remains is determining the right time corresponding to each obtained value.\n\nThe right times (t1 and t2) associated with the topocentric right ascension values derived from the two sets far from transit are non-critical; thus, they can be obtained just from averaging the times of the corresponding images. However, the two transit times (T01 and T02) are critical \u2013 even a difference of a few seconds is important \u2013 so that they must be determined precisely by making careful use of the data around the transit on each night.\n\nThe easiest way to find the precise transit time for each night is by using a spreadsheet. The rows contain data corresponding to each image around transit, while the column headings consist of (1) the obtained target\u2019s topocentric right ascension value, (2) the image\u2019s time, and (3) the corresponding local sidereal time (expressed in the same units as the topocentric right ascension values). Then, in a fourth column, the local sidereal time will be subtracted from the target\u2019s topocentric right ascension value. Finally, the exact transit time will be calculated by making use of the intercept function applied to data in columns (2) and (4). \n\n###Step 5: Computing data\nOnce the four data points [RAtopo(t1), t1], [RAtopo(T01), T01], [RAtopo(t2), t2], [RAtopo(T02), T02] are known, proper manipulation according to the equations of the 4-Point Backyard Diurnal Parallax Method is all that is required.\n\nFrom equation (4), the linear approximation for finding out RAgeo at any time becomes known, so that from equation (1), the diurnal parallax angle \u03c6 at times t1 and t2 becomes known. Once \u03c6(t1) is known, from equation (2), the maximum amplitude of the variable diurnal parallax angle for the first night (\u03c6max1) can be readily obtained, with the help of\n\n\u03c6 (t1) = \u03c6max1 sin (\u03c9 (T01 \u2013 t1))\n\nSimilarly, the maximum amplitude of the variable diurnal parallax angle for the second night (\u03c6max2) can be computed from\n\n\u03c6 (t2) = \u03c6max2 sin (\u03c9 (T02 \u2013 t2))\n\nFinally, from equation (5), the key value \u03c6max becomes known, so that from equation (3), the distance to the asteroid is determined.\n\nStep 6: Assessing the quality of the found distance\nStudents have to compare their outcome with the published values. Analysis of possible error sources and their relative importance should be critically discussed.\n\nStep 7: Writing a formal report\nThe activity should conclude with the writing of a succinct scientific report on the determined asteroid distance and its comparison with actual distance, along with a critical discussion about the potential sources (and their corresponding relative weights) of found discrepancy and ways to minimize them in further attempts.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "Two related published papers:\n\nDiurnal Parallax Determinations of Asteroid Distances Using Only Backyard Observations from a Single Station\nhttp://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SASS...31...45A \n\nThe 4-Point Backyard Diurnal Parallax Method Tested on a Challenging Far Away Target: Dwarf Planet 134340 Pluto\nhttp://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013SASS...32...25A\n\nTwo related PPTs:\n(in English): Diurnal Parallax Determinations of Asteroid Distances Using Only Backyard Observations from a Single Station\nhttp://www.olasu.com.uy/contenidos.php?action=detalle&amp;idmenu=12&amp;idcontenido=117 \n\n(in Spanish): Nuevo y Simple M\u00e9todo para la Medici\u00f3n del Paralaje Diario de Cuerpos Menores del Sistema Solar, requiriendo solo cuatro datos a partir de im\u00e1genes obtenidas desde un \u00fanico lugar\nhttp://www.olasu.com.uy/contenidos.php?action=detalle&amp;idmenu=12&amp;idcontenido=116 \n\nAuthor\u2019s website: http://www.olasu.com.uy \n\n\n", "conclusion": "This activity will allow students to measure, on their own, the parallax angle of a selected asteroid and its distance, within an accuracy of 5%, in just two nights by using modest amateur gear.

In ancient and prehistoric times, the sky certainly had a different significance than it does today. This is reflected in the many myths about the sky all around the world. As a result, we can assume that the processes in the sky have been watched and monitored closely. In doing this, the underlying cycles and visible phenomena were easy to observe.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/CardinalDirections.png) \n**Figure 1**: Apparent diurnal movement of the Sun in the Northern Hemisphere at equinox. The Sun reaches its highest elevation above the horizon to the south. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Sun culminates to the north (Credit: Tau\u02bbolunga, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Equinox-50.jpg, \u2018Equinox-50\u2019, horizontal coordinate system and annotations added by Markus Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\nFor any given position on Earth except the equatorial region, the Sun always culminates towards the same direction (Figure 1). The region between the two tropics 23.5\u00b0 north and south of the equator is special, because the Sun can attain zenith positions at local noon throughout the year. During night, the stars rotate around the celestial poles. Archaeological evidence from prehistoric eras like burial sites and the orientation of buildings suggest that the cardinal directions were common knowledge to a multitude of cultures many millennia ago (e.g. McKim Malville & Putnam, 1993; Rudgeley, 2000; Schmidt-Kaler & Schlosser, 1984). Therefore, it is obvious that they were applied to early navigation. The magnetic compass was unknown in Europe until the 13th century CE (Lane, 1963).\n\n**Latitude and longitude**\n\n ![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth.png)\n**Figure 2:** Illustration of how the latitudes and longitudes of the Earth are defined (Credits: Peter Mercator, djexplo, CC0).\nAny location on an area is defined by two coordinates. The surface of a sphere is a curved area, so using coordinates like up and down does not make much sense, because the surface of a sphere has neither a beginning nor an end. Instead, we can use spherical polar coordinates originating from the centre of the sphere with the radius being fixed (Figure 2). Two angular coordinates remain. When applied to the Earth, they are called the latitude and the longitude. Its rotation provides the sym\u00acmetry axis. The North Pole is defined as the point, where the theoretical axis of rotation meets the surface of the sphere and the rotation is counter-clockwise when looking at the North Pole from above. The opposite point is the South Pole. The equator is defined as the great circle half way between the two poles.\n\nThe latitudes are circles parallel to the equator. They are counted from 0\u00b0 at the equator to \u00b190\u00b0 at the poles. The longitudes are great circles connecting the two poles of the Earth. For a given position on Earth, the longitude going through the zenith, the point directly above, is called the meridian. This is the line the Sun apparently crosses at local noon. The origin of this coordinate is the Prime Meridian, and passes Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory of England is located. From there, longi\u00actudes are counted from 0\u00b0 to \u00b1180\u00b0.\n\nExample: Heidelberg in Germany is located at 49.4\u00b0 North and 8.7\u00b0 East.\n\n**Elevation of the pole (pole height)**\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/Live_Oak_star_trails-Flickr.jpg)\n**Figure 3:** Trails of stars in the sky after an exposure time of approximately 2 hours (Credit: Ralph Arvesen, Live Oak star trails, https://www.flickr.com/photos/rarvesen/9494908143, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode).\n\nIf we project the terrestrial coordinate system of the latitudes and longitudes on the sky, we get the celestial equatorial coordinate system. The Earth\u2019s equator becomes the celestial equator and the geographic poles are extrapolated to build the celestial poles. If we were to take a photograph with a long exposure of the northern sky, we would see from the trails of the stars that they all revolve about a common point, the northern celestial pole (Figure 3).\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/Ursa_Major_-_Ursa_Minor_-_Polaris_t4K2CXo.jpg)\n**Figure 4:** Configuration of the two constellations Ursa Major (Great Bear) and Ursa Minor (Little Bear) in the northern sky. Polaris, the North Star, which is close to the true celestial north pole, is the brightest star in Ursa Minor (Credit: Bon\u010d, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ursa_Major_-_Ursa_Minor_-_Polaris.jpg, \u2018Ursa Major \u2013 Ursa Minor \u2013 Polaris\u2019, based on https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ursa_Major_and_Ursa_Minor_Constellations.jpg, colours inverted by Markus Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, there is a moderately bright star near the celestial pole, the North Star or Polaris. It is the brightest star in the constellation the Little Bear, Ursa Minor (Figure 4). In our era, Polaris is less than a degree off. However, 1000 years ago, it was 8\u00b0 away from the pole. Therefore, today we can use it as a proxy for the position of the celestial north pole. At the southern celestial pole, there is no such star that can be observed with the naked eye. Other methods have to be used to find it.\n\nIf we stood exactly at the geographic North Pole, Polaris would always be directly overhead. We can say that its elevation would be (almost) 90\u00b0. This information introduces the horizontal coordinate system (Figure 5). It is the natural reference we use every day. We, the observers, are the origin of that coordinate system located on a flat plane, whose edge is the horizon. The sky is imagined as a hemisphere above. The angle between an object in the sky and the horizon is the alti\u00actude or elevation. The direction within the plane is given as an angle between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, the azi\u00acmuth, which is usually counted clockwise from north. In navigation, this is also called the bearing. The meridian is the line that connects North and South poles at the horizon and passes the zenith.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.png)\n**Figure 5:** Illustration of the horizontal coordinate system. The observer is the origin of the coordinates assigned as azi-muth and altitude or elevation (Credit: TWCarlson, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.svg, \u2018Azimuth-Altitude schematic\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\nFor any other position on Earth, the celestial pole or Polaris would appear at an elevation smaller than 90\u00b0. At the equator, it would just graze the horizon, i.e. be at an elevation of 0\u00b0. The correla-tion between the latitude (North Pole = 90\u00b0, Equator = 0\u00b0) and the elevation of Polaris is no coinci-dence. Figure 6 combines all the three mentioned coordinate systems. For a given observer, at any lati\u00actude on Earth, the local horizontal coordinate system touches the terrestrial spherical polar coordi\u00acnate system at a single tangent point. The sketch demonstrates that the elevation of the celestial north pole, also called the pole height, is exactly equal to the northern latitude of the observer on Earth.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/PoleHeightLatitude_high_low.png)\n**Figure 6:** When combining the three coordinate systems (terrestrial spherical, celestial equatorial, local horizontal), it becomes clear that the latitude of the observer is exactly the elevation of the celestial pole, also known as the pole height (Credit: own work).\nFrom this, we can conclude that if we measure the elevation of Polaris, we can determine our lati-tude on Earth with reasonable precision.\n\n**Circumpolar stars and constellations**\n\nIn ancient history, e.g. in the Bronze Age, Polaris could not be used to determine north. Because of the precession of the axis of the Earth, it was about 30\u00b0 away from the celestial north pole in 3,500 BCE. Instead, the star Thuban (\u03b1 Draconis) was more appropriate, as it was less than 4\u00b0 off. However, it was consid\u00acerably fainter than Polaris and perhaps not always visible to the naked eye.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/NorthernHemisphere2750BCE-2016CE.png)\n**Figure 7:** Star charts of the northern celestial pole region for the years 2750 BCE and 2016 CE (Credits: own work, created with XEphem Version 3.7.6, produced by Elwood C. Downey and distributed by the Clear Sky Institute Inc., Solon, Iowa, USA, http://www.xephem.com).\n\nWhen looking at the night sky, some stars within a certain radius around the celestial poles never set; they are circumpolar (see Figure 3). Navigators were skilled enough to determine the true posi\u00action of the celestial pole by observing a few stars close to it. This method also works for the southern celestial pole. There are two videos that demonstrate the phenomenon.\n\nCircumpolarStars Heidelberg 49degN (Duration: 0:57)\nhttps://youtu.be/uzeey9VPA48\n\nCircumpolarStars Habana 23degN (Duration: 0:49)\nhttps://youtu.be/zggfQC_d7UQ\n\nThey show the movement of the night sky when looking north for two different latitudes, coinciding with the cities of Heidelberg, Germany (49\u00b0 North) and Lisbon, Portugal (23\u00b0 North). The videos illustrate the following:\n1.\tThere are always stars and constellations that never set. Those are the circumpolar stars and constellations.\n2.\tThe angle between the celestial pole (Polaris) and the horizon depends on the latitude of the observer. In fact, these angles are identical.\n3.\tThe circumpolar region depends on the latitude of the observer. It is bigger for locations closer to the pole.\nIf the students are familiar with the use of a planisphere, they can study the same phenomenon by watching the following two videos. They show the rotation of the sky for the latitudes 20\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. The transparent area reveals the visible sky for a given point in time. The dashed circle indicates the region of circumpolar stars and constellations.\n\nCircumPolarStars phi N20 (Duration: 0:37)\nhttps://youtu.be/Uv-xcdqhV00\n\nCircumPolarStars phi N45 (Duration: 0:37)\nhttps://youtu.be/VZ6RmdzbpPw\n\nWhen sailing north or south, sailors observe that with changing elevation of the celestial pole, the circumpolar range is altered, too. Therefore, whenever navigators see the same star or constellation culminating \u2013 i.e. passing the meridian \u2013 at the same elevation, they stay on the \u2018latitude\u2019. Although the educated ancient Greeks were familiar with the concept of latitude of a spherical Earth, common sailors were probably not. For them, it was sufficient to realise the connection between the elevation of stars and their course. Ancient navigators knew the night sky very well. They utilised the relative positions of constellation to determine their position in terms of latitude.\n\n**Early seafaring and navigation in the Mediterranean**\n\nNavigation using celestial objects is a skill that was practised long before humans roamed the Earth. Today, we know numerous examples of animals who find their course using the day or night sky. Bees and monarch butterflies navigate by the Sun (Sauman et al., 2005), just like starlings (Kramer, 1952). Even more impressive is the ability of birds (Emlen, 1970; Lockley, 1967; Sauer, 1958) and seals (Mauck, Gl\u00e4ser, Schlosser, & Dehnhardt, 2008) that identify the position of stars during night-time for steering a course. However, in our modern civilisation with intense illumination of cities, strong lights can be mistaken for celestial objects. For instance, moths use the moon to maintain a constant course, but if confused by a street lamp, they keep circling around it until exhaustion (Stevenson, 2008). Hence, light pollution is a serious threat to many animals. The magni\u00actude of the problem is shown in Figure 8.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/ISS-40_Iberian_Peninsula_at_night.jpg)\n**Figure 8:** The Iberian Peninsula at night seen from the International Space Station (Credit: Image courtesy of the Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, NASA Johnson Space Center, mission-roll-frame no.

The oldest records of seafaring in the Mediterranean date back to 7,000 BCE (Hertel, 1990), done on boats or small ships that were propelled by paddles only. The routes were restricted close to the coast, where landmarks helped navigate to the desired destinations. To cross larger distances, a propulsion mechanism independent of muscle force was needed. Therefore, the sail was one of the most important inventions in human history, similar in its significance to the wheel. Around the middle of the 4th millennium BCE, Egyptian ships sailed the eastern Mediterranean (Bohn, 2011) and established trade routes with Byblos in Phoenicia, the biblical Canaan, now Lebanon. This is about the time when the Bronze Age began. Tin was an important item in the Bronze Age, and tin sources in central and western Europe triggered large scale trade (Penhallurick, 1986). Transportation over large distances inside and outside the Mediterranean was accomplished by ships.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/Metallurgical_diffusion.png)\n**Figure 9:** Map of the diffusion of metallurgy. Bronze Age tin deposits were mostly found at the European Atlantic coast (Credit: User: Hamelin de Guettelet, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metallurgical_diffusion.png, public domain).\n\nSoon, the navigators realised that celestial objects, especially stars, can be used to keep the course of a ship. Such skills have been mentioned in early literature like Homer\u2019s Odyssey which is believed to date back to 8th century BCE. The original sources are thought to originate from the Bronze Age, in which the Minoans of Crete were a particularly influential people. They lived between 3,650 and 1,450 BCE in the northern Mediterranean region and sailed the Aegean Sea. Since many of their sacral buildings were aligned with the cardinal directions and astronomical phenomena like the rising Sun and the equinoxes (Henriksson & Blomberg, 2008, 2009), it is reasonable to believe that they used this knowledge for navigation, too (Blomberg & Henriksson, 1999). The Minoans sailed to the island of Thera and Egypt, which would have taken them several days on open water.\n  \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/Crete_integrated_map-en.svg.png)\n**Figure 10:** Map of Crete with ancient Minoan sites in the early 2nd millennium BCE (Credit: Eric Gaba (Sting), https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crete_integrated_map-en.svg, annotations in red by Markus Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).\n\nThe Greek poet Aratos of Soli published his Phainomena around 275 BCE (Aratus, Callimachus, & Lycophron, 1921), describing in detail the positions of constellations and their order of rising and setting. This was vital information for any navigator to maintain a given course. He would simply have pointed his ship at a bearing and be able to keep it, with the help of stellar constellations that appeared towards that heading. The azimuth of a given star when rising or setting remains con-stant throughout the year, except for a slow variation over 26,000 years caused by the pre\u00accession of the Earth axis. Interestingly, Aratos\u2019 positions did not fit the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age but suited the era of the Minoan reign (Blomberg & Henriksson, 1999) some 2,000 years earlier.\nAround 1,200 BCE, the Phoenicians became the dominating civilisation in the Mediterranean. They built colonies along the southern and western coasts of the Mediterranean and beyond. Among them was the colony of Gades (now Cad\u00edz), just outside the Strait of Gibraltar, which served as a trading point for goods and resources from northern Europe (Cunliffe, 2003; Hertel, 1990). Several documented voyages through the Atlantic Ocean took them to Britain and even several hundred miles south along the African coast (Johnson & Nurminen, 2009). \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/FromCreteToAlexandria_2000BCE_22S_G3fzye5.png)\n**Figure 11:** The night sky with bearing from Crete to Alexandria for 22 September 2000 BCE, 21:30 UT (Credit: own work, created with Stellarium, free GNU GPL software, after Blomberg & Henriksson (1999), Fig. 9).\n\nThe Greek historian Herodotus (ca. 484 \u2013 420 BCE) reports of a Phoenician expedition funded by the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II (610 \u2013 595 BCE) that set out from the Red Sea to circumnavigate Africa and returned to Egypt via the Mediterranean (Bohn, 2011; Hertel, 1990; Johnson & Nurminen, 2009). The sailors apparently reported that at times the Sun was located north (Cunliffe, 2003), which is expected after crossing the equator to the south. All this speaks in favour of extraordinary navigational skills. After the Persians conquered the Phoenician homeland in 539 BCE, their influence declined, but was re-established by descendants of their colonies, the Carthaginians.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/PhoenicianTrade_EN.svg.png)\n**Figure 12:** Trade routes of the Phoenicians during the European Bronze Age (Credit: DooFi, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PhoenicianTrade_EN.svg, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\nlegalcode).\n\n\n**Pytheas**\n\nA very notable and well documented long distance voyage has been described by ancient authors and scholars like Strabo, Pliny and Diodorus of Sicily. It is the voyage of Pytheas (ca. 380 \u2013 310 BCE), a Greek astronomer, geographer and explorer from Marseille who at around 320 BCE apparently left the Mediterranean, travelled along the European west coast and made it up north until the British Isles and beyond the Arctic Circle, during which he possibly reached Iceland or the Faroe Islands that he called Thule (Baker & Baker, 1997; Cunliffe, 2003; Hergt, 1893).\nMassalia (or Massilia), as Thule was called then, was founded by Phocean Greeks around 600 BCE and quickly evolved into one of the biggest and wealthiest Greek outposts in the western Mediterranean with strong trade relations to Celtic tribes who occupied most of Europe (Cunliffe, 2003). Pytheas was born in the Late Bronze Age, when the trade with regions in northern Europe was flourishing. Not much was known in Greek geography about this part of the world, except that the barbarians living there mined tin ore and delivered the precious amber that the whole Mediterranean so desperately sought. Perhaps, it was out of pure curiosity that Pytheas set out to explore these shores.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/Pythas.jpg)\n**Figure 13:** Statue of Pytheas, erected at the Palais de la Bourse in Marseille in honour of his achievements (Credit: Rvalette, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pyth\u00e9as.jpg, \u2018Pyth\u00e9as\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\nHis voyage was a milestone, because Pytheas was a scientist and a great observer. He used a gnomon or a sundial, which allowed him to determine his latitude and measure the time during his voyage (Nansen, 1911). He also noticed that in summer the Sun shone longer at higher latitudes. In addition, he was the first to notice a relation between the tides, which are practically absent in the Mediterranean, and the lunar phases (Roller, 2006).\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/The_journey_of_Pytheas_node_full_image_2.jpg)\n**Figure 14:** The journey of Pytheas of Massalia according to Cunliffe (2003) (Credit: ESA/Cunliffe, http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2005/09/The_journey_of_Pytheas, http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/ESA_Multimedia/Copyright_Notice_Images).\n\n\n###Glossary\n\n**Apparent movement**\nMovement of celestial objects which is in fact caused by the rotation of the earth.\n\n**Cardinal directions**\nMain directions, i.e. North, South, West, East\n\n**Circumpolar**\nProperty of celestial objects that never set below the horizon.\n\n**Culmination**\nPassing the meridian of celestial objects.

This is called precession. As a result, the rotation axis constantly changes its orientation and points to different points in space. The full cycle of precession of the Earth axis takes roughly 26,000 years. \n\n**Spherical polar coordinates**\nThe natural coordinate system of a flat plane is Cartesian and measures distances in two perpendicular directions (ahead, back, left, right). For a sphere, this is not very useful, because it has neither a beginning nor an end. Instead, the fixed point is the centre of the sphere. When projected outside from the central position, any point on the surface of the sphere can be determined by two angles with one of them being related to the symmetry axis. Such axis defines two poles. In addition, there is the radius that represents the third dimension of space, which permits determining each point within a sphere. This defines the spherical polar coordinates. When defining points on the surface of a sphere, the radius stays constant.\n\n**Sundial**\nA stick that projects a shadow cast by the Sun.

This would prepare the field in a much more interactive way than what a teacher can achieve by summarising the facts.\n\nStudents could be shown some good documentaries available on sea exploration. As an introduction to celestial navigation in general and the early navigators, let the students watch the following videos. The last one is in French. This could be done in conjunction with French lessons in school. If not, narrate the story of Pytheas as outlined in the background information. A link to literature or history classes may be established by reading \u2018The Extraordinary Voyage of Pytheas\u2019 by B.

One may point out the migration of the homo sapiens to islands and isolated continents like Australia.\n\nPossible answers:\nWe know for sure that ships have been used to cross large distances since 3,000 BCE or earlier. However, the early settlers of Australia must have found a way to cross the Oceans around 50,000 BCE\n\n\nAsk them, what could have been the benefit of exploring the seas. Perhaps, someone knows historic cultures or people who were famous sailors. The teacher can support this with a few examples of ancient seafaring peoples, e.g. from the Mediterranean.\n\nPossible answers:\nFinding new resources and food, trade, spirit of exploration, curiosity.\n\n\nAsk the students, how they find their way to school every day. What supports their orientation so that they do not get lost? When reference points (buildings, traffic lights, bus stops, etc.) have been mentioned, ask the students how navigators were able to find their way on the seas. In early times, they used sailing directions in connection to landmarks that could be recognised. But for this, the ships would have to stay close to the coast. Lighthouses improved the situation. Magnetic compasses were invented rather late around the 11th century CE, and they were not used in Europe before the 13th century. But what could be used as reference points at open sea? The students may mention celestial objects like the Sun, the Moon and stars.\n\n\nSuggested additional questions, especially after showing the introductory videos\nQ: Who was Pytheas?\nA: He was an ancient Greek scientist and explorer.\n\nQ: Where and when did he live?\nA: He lived in 4th century BCE during the Late Bronze Age in Massalia, now Marseille.\n\nQ: Where did he travel?\nA: Pytheas travelled north along the Atlantic coast of Europe to Britain and probably to the Arctic Circle and Iceland.\n\nQ: What did he observe and discover during his voyage?\nA: He was the first Greek to travel far into the north. He noticed that the length of daylight depends on latitude. He was also the first to relate the tides to the phases of the moon.\n\n\n\n###Activity 1: Circumpolar constellations and stars\nMaterials needed:\n\tWorksheets\n\tCompasses\n\tPencil\n\tRuler\n\tCalculator\n\nIn the absence of a bright star at the celestial poles, ancient navigators were able to find the celestial poles by observing a few circumpolar stars. These navigators were experienced enough to determine the true north by recognising the relative position of such stars and by their paths around it.\n\nIn addition, they used circumpolar constellations and stars to infer their latitude. They never rise or set \u2013 they are always above the horizon. While today we can simply measure the elevation of Polaris above the horizon, ancient navigators saw Polaris many degrees away from the celestial north pole. In the Southern Hemisphere, there is no such stellar indicator anyway. So, instead of measuring the elevation of Polaris, they observed the stars and constellations that were still visible above the horizon when they attained their lowest elevation above the horizon (lower culmination) during their apparent orbit around the celestial pole.\n\nLet the students watch the following two videos that demonstrate the phenomenon of circumpolar stars and constellations for two locations on earth. They show the simulated daily apparent rotation of the sky around the northern celestial pole.\n\nCircumpolarStars Heidelberg 49degN (Duration: 0:57)\nhttps://youtu.be/uzeey9VPA48\n\nCircumpolarStars Habana 23degN (Duration: 0:49)\nhttps://youtu.be/zggfQC_d7UQ\n\nThe students will notice that\n\tThere are always stars and constellations that never set. Those are the circumpolar stars and constellations.\n\tThe angle between the celestial pole (Polaris) and the horizon depends on the latitude of the observer. In fact, these angles are identical.\n\tThe circumpolar region depends on the latitude of the observer. It is bigger for locations closer to the pole.\nIf the students are familiar with the use of a planisphere, they can study the same phenomenon by watching the following two videos.\nCircumPolarStars phi N20 (Duration: 0:37)\nhttps://youtu.be/Uv-xcdqhV00\nCircumPolarStars phi N45 (Duration: 0:37)\nhttps://youtu.be/VZ6RmdzbpPw\nThey show the rotation of the sky for the latitudes 20\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. The transparent area reveals the visible sky for a given point in time. The dashed circle indicates the region of circumpolar stars and constellations.\n\n\n**Questions**\nQ: What is special about the geographic North and South Poles of the Earth compared to other locations?\nA: They define the rotation axis of the earth.\n\nQ: How do you find north and the other cardinal directions without a compass?\nA: Celestial bodies, e.g. stars like Polaris, indicate the celestial north pole.\n\nQ: Why does the North Star (Polaris) indicate North?\nA: In our lifetime, Polaris is close to the celestial north pole.\n\nQ: Where in the sky would you find the celestial north/south pole if you stood exactly at the terrestrial North/South Pole?\nA: At the zenith, i.e. directly overhead.\n\nQ: How would this position change, if you travelled towards the equator?\nA: Its elevation would decline from zenith to the horizon.\n\nQ: What are circumpolar constellations?\nA: These are constellations that revolve around one of the celestial poles and never rise or set. They are always above the horizon.\n\nQ: Which of the visible constellations would be circumpolar, if you stood on the terrestrial North/South Pole or the equator?\nA: The entire Northern/Southern Hemisphere (poles). None at the equator.\n\nQ: If the North Star was not visible, how would you be able to determine your latitude?\nA: Since the circumpolar stars and constellations depend on the latitude, just like the elevation of Polaris, the ones that always stay above the horizon will indicate where I am.\n\n\n**Exercise**\n\nThe task is now to walk in the footsteps of a navigator that lived around 5,000 years ago. Using those skills, the students will determine the constellations that are circumpolar when observed from given positions on Earth.\n\nThe table below contains the names of six cities along with their latitudes \u03c6. Negative values indicate southern latitudes. The seventh row is empty, where the students can add the details of their home town. From this, they will have to calculate the angular radii \u03f1 from the celestial pole. The calculation is simple, because it is the same as the pole height and the latitude:\n\n\u03c6=\u03f1\n\nThen they can select the map that matches the hemisphere. The students use the compasses to draw circles of those radii around the corresponding pole. The constellations inside that circle are circumpolar. The constellations that are fully or partially visible for a given city are added to the table.\n\nPossible solutions are added in italics. The table prepared for the exercise is contained in the worksheet.\n\n\nCity | Latitude (\u00b0) | Radius in map (cm) | Constellations\n-|-|-|-\nTunis (ancient Carthage, Tunisia) | 36.8 | 3.7 | *Ursa Minor, Ursa Major (Big Dipper), Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia*\nCape Town (South Africa) |\t-33.9 | 3.4 | *Crux, Pavo (Peacock), Achernar, most of Carina, Toliman of Centaurus*\nPlymouth (UK) |\t50.4 | 5.0 | *Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Perseus (mostly), part of Cygnus with Deneb*\nWellington (New Zealand) | -41.3 | 4.1 |\t*Carina (incl. Canopus), Ara, Pictor, Dorado*\nMumbai (India) | 19.0 | 1.9 | *Ursa Minor*\nGrytviken (South Georgia) | -54.3 | 5.4|*Centaurus (complete), Lupus, Main part of Puppis, Phoenix, Grus*\n|||-\n\n**Table 1:** List of cities along with their latitudes. The solutions from activity 1 are added in italic writing. \n\n**Detailed instructions**\n\tDetermine the map scale. The angular scale is 90\u00b0 from the poles to the outer circle, i.e. the celestial equator.\n\tConvert the latitudes in the table into radii in the scale of the maps and add them to the table.\n\tFor each of the cities:\n\tSelect the suitable map.\n\tUse the compass to draw a circle with a radius that was determined for that city.\n\tFind and note the visible circumpolar constellations. If they are too many, just select the most prominent ones.\n\n**Discussion**\nIn ancient times, Polaris did not coincide with the celestial north pole. Explain the importance of circumpolar stars and constellations for ancient navigators.\n\n**Possible result:**\nThey provided an excellent tool to maintain latitude and prevented navigators from getting lost at open sea.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/NorthernCelestialHemisphere.png)\n**Figure 15a:** Star chart of the Northern Hemisphere \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/SouthernCelestialHemisphere.png)\n**Figure 15b:** Star chart of the Southern Hemisphere (Credit: Markus Nielbock, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NorthernCelestialHemisphere.png, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SouthernCelestialHemisphere.png, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode, created with PP3, http://pp3.sourceforge.net)\n\n**Solutions**\nThe map scale is: 1cm \u221d 10\u00b0\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/NorthernCelestialHemisphere_solutions.png)\nNorthern sky\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/SouthernCelestialHemisphere_solutions.png)\nSouthern Sky\n \n\n\n###Activity 2: Stars guide the way\n**Materials needed:**\n\tWorksheet\n\tPencil\n\tProtractor\n\tComputer with MS Excel installed\n\tExcel spreadsheet \u2018AncientMediterranean_BrightStars_EUSPACE-AWE_Navigation.xlsx\u2019\n\nIn the absence of a star like Polaris that indicates a celestial pole, ancient navigators used other stars and constellations to determine cardinal directions and their ship\u2019s course. They realised that the positions where they appear and disappear at the horizon (the bearings) do not change during a lifetime. Experienced navigators knew the brightest stars and constellations by heart.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/brightStarsAzimuths_noNames.png) \n**Figure 16:** Bearings of selected rising bright stars for latitude 45\u00b0 at an elevation of 10\u00b0 above the horizon (own work).\n\n**Questions**\n\nQ: Can you determine the cardinal directions from other stars than Polaris? Note that there is no star at the South Pole.\nA: Yes. If you know the stars and constellations, they can guide the way, as they return to the same positions each day.\n\nQ: How can you use rising and setting stars and constellations to steer a course on sea?\nA: The position at the horizon when rising and setting does not change (except for a very slow long term variation).\n\nQ: Would you be able to see the same stars every night during the year?\nA: No, the time of rising and setting changes. Stars visible during winter nights are up during summer daytimes.\n\n**Exercise**\nThe students will produce a stellar compass similar to Figure 16. The calculations that are needed to convert the sky coordinates of the stars into horizontal coordinates, i.e. azimuth and elevation, are quite complex. Therefore, this activity comes with an Excel file that does it for them. It consists of 57 bright stars plus the Pleiades, which is a very prominent group of stars.\n\nAll they have to do is enter the latitude of their location and the elevation of the stars in the corresponding line at the bottom of the spreadsheet. For the elevation, 10\u00b0 is a good value. This means that they will get the azimuths of the stars when observed at an elevation of 10\u00b0. One can also use different values, but this exercise is meant for finding stars that just rise or set. The azimuth is an angle along the horizon, counting clockwise from the north.\n\nThe last two columns (AZ1, AZ2) then display two azimuths, one when the star is rising and one when the star is setting. Note that the distribution of azimuths for rising and setting stars is symmetric relative to the meridian, i.e. the line that connects North and South. The cells that show #NA do not contain valid numbers. These stars never rise or set. They are either circumpolar or below the horizon.\n\nThe students translate the values into the stellar compass below. They use a protractor and indicate the position of each star on the circle. Then they write its name next to it.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/6d2285b7-d957-475f-92b6-a0868063a802/StellarCompass.png)\n\n**Discussion**\nOne of the methods to navigate through the ancient Mediterranean was to stay close to the shores. Besides the danger of shallow waters, explain why Bronze Age mariners must have developed methods that would allow them to safely navigate on open waters. You may want to look at a map of the Mediterranean.\n\n**Possible answers:**\nThe ancient people visited islands for trade or other reasons. Many of them are not visible from the Mediterranean coastlines. The voyages would often last longer than a few hours. Vessels of that age were able to cover five nautical miles per hour on average. There are also reports that were passed on through the ages which tell us about celestial navigation.\n\n\n###Activity 3: Do it yourself! (Supplemental)\n**Materials needed:**\n\tResults of the previous activities\n\tPortable red lamp e.g. a dimmed torch or a torch covered with a red filter\n\tA magnetic compass if available\n\nNothing is more instructive than applying what has been learned and exercised in theory to real conditions. Therefore, the results from the previous two activities can be tested in the field by observing the night sky.\n\nThis activity can be done by the students themselves at home or as a group event with the class.\n\nSelect a clear evening and a site with a good view of the horizon. Once it is dark enough to see the stars, let the students use their dimmed torches to inspect their maps with the circumpolar ranges from activity 1. A dimmed torch \u2013 better still, a red one \u2013 helps to keep the eyes adapted to the dark.\n\nAfter identifying the brightest stars, let them use their stellar compasses from activity 2. The students should point the markers of one or some of the stars to the stars at the sky. Let them identify north (or south, depending on which celestial pole is visible from your location). If in the Northern Hemisphere, does this match the direction to the North Star, Polaris? In the Southern Hemisphere, a magnetic compass might be needed.\n\nLet the students identify the constellations they see in the sky on their maps. Ask them to look north (south in the Southern Hemisphere) and name the stars and constellations that are just above the horizon. Does this coincide with the maps? Note that there should be a circle that indicates the circumpolar range for the local latitude.\n\nTry to highlight that by doing this activity, they are working like the navigators from 4,000 years ago.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "This lesson unit provides an insight into the navigational methods of the Bronze Age Mediterranean peoples.

It is about the *geography / geology of planets*, and about how to read and make maps (cartographic representation). At elementary school level, the concept of \u201cgeography\u201d (that can be a part of the more general \u201cScience\u201d curriculum) covers basic concepts of several fields in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, for example geology, geomorphology, cartography, meteorology and climatology. We follow this concept. \n\n**What is this activity NOT about?** This activity is not a planetary science image interpretation practice. This is also not an introduction to the structure of the Solar System or Astronomy. Astronomy is a completely different discipline from planetary science. The subject of Planetology is planetary bodies, and an important part of it is called *astrogeology*, which studies the surface geology of planets and moons. This activity is an astrogeologic and planetary cartographic activity. Astronomy is about for example stars, galaxies, and the celestial motions of planets.\n\n**Cartographic problems:** The maps show the bodies in Lambert Projection (two separate hemispheric views. This requires additional explanation from the teacher on how two \u201csides\u201d of a sphere is projected into two circular views which is not therefore not the view of two different bodies). \n\n**Astrobiology:** About \u201calien\u201d creatures: On the map, every geologic feature shown is real and placed at their true position, however the living creatures are completely fictional which also requires the teacher\u2019s explanation so that the students will not think that people or \u201caliens\u201d live on planets and moons. It should be clarified that no life or sign of past life has ever been identified on any planet or moon other than on Earth. This might be a good opportunity to talk about the billions of exoplanets that exist in the universe that, unlike most extra-terrestrial Solar System planets and moons, include millions of planets and moons where conditions are much more favourable for life than extra-terrestrial worlds within our Solar System. An exciting new part of planetary science is exoplanetology, which deals with planets outside our Solar System. Many of those exoplanets and exomoons are completely different from those in our Solar System.\nThe very basis of space missions is to search for life. On Mars, scientists are looking for places where life could have developed in the past or may have survived in geologic refuges (caves, in the subsurface, within rocks, water-containing layers etc.). This is why NASA was looking for signs of water. Now that water (ice) containing sites and geologic units have been identified, they are searching for signs of past or present life. Europa may have a subsurface ocean that is exposed to space in new fractures. Scientist today are looking for life forms that are based on the same materials as terrestrial life, i.e. carbon-based life that relies on water, so they are looking for places where water can exist in liquid form. Other forms of life may exist, however as we do not know about them or how to identify them, the main focus is searching for identifiable carbon-based life.\n\n**About space programs:** In addition to search for life, or bodies and regions that are habitable for terrestrial-like life, space programs are also motivated by the competition between countries. Space exploration also helps understand the geological processes on our planet and Earth\u2019s past and future. For example, the intense greenhouse effect on Venus can help predict similar processes in Earth\u2019s future or impact craters show how the Earth looked like 4 billion years ago. One of the most unexpected results of the Apollo program that sent humans on to the Moon was the so-called \u201coverview effect\u201d: this was the first \u2013 and so far, last \u2013 time when human eyes saw our planet as a fragile \u201cblue marble\u201d against the black space that changed our perception of our world and our place in the universe. \n\n**About space research:** Individual scientists can do research on a single landform for years, trying to explain how and when it formed. Others map specific regions in detail and classify the features seen on the maps. After a scientist publishes the results of the research, it becomes a little brick in the large building of planetary science and other scientists can use these results to improve their surface evolution models or can use these results in their own research. \nMost of the content shown on these maps were obtained in the last decades, in some cases, only in recent years. The formation of some landforms is still not fully understood. \n\n###General descriptions of parameters that could be discussed when characterizing the chosen planet or moon.\n\n**Body type:** Planet or moon. Planets orbit the Sun, moons orbit a planet. One side of a moon generally always faces its planet (tidally locked).  \n**Body composition:** Rocky bodies are made of silicate rocks (example Earth). Icy bodies are made of a rock and H2O ice mixture but their surfaces are usually mostly ice (example: Europa). On these worlds mountains and plains are made of rock-hard ice. Icy bodies occur only in the colder Outer Solar System.  \n**Atmosphere:** Atmospheres only occur if the gravity (and size) of the body is sufficient to hold gas molecules. It is easier to hold a gas molecule if it is colder.  \n**Liquid:** Liquids may be water in the inner Solar System or methane-ethane-nitrogen in the Outer Solar System. Liquids only occur where there is an atmosphere that produces air pressure. If air pressure is too low, liquid molecules evaporate/sublimate. If temperature is too low, liquids freeze. If temperature is too high, liquids evaporate. Water may exist underground. \n**Weather:** Diurnal temperature range (changes in temperature due to day and night) and forms of precipitation.  \n**Endogenic features:** Features produced by forces in the interior of the planet. **Volcanism** requires molten interior. Heat is provided from planetary formation (impact / accretion heat) or the irreversible decay of radioactive elements. Small bodies cool quicker than large bodies, so volcanism is found only on larger planets. An exception is if the interior is continuously heated. This happens inside moons on elliptic orbits where tidal forces produce interior heat (e.g. Io).  **Tectonic** features are caused by stresses in the brittle crust.  Tectonic forces produce fractures during earthquakes. This requires movements within the planet, also driven by internal heat. Volcanoes grow upward by adding more lava but may collapse and produce crater-like caldera. \n**Exogenic features:** Features produced by processes on the surface or atmosphere. Includes aeolian (wind), fluvial (river), lacustrine (lake), oceanic features and their deposits.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** Features produced by impacting bodies (smaller craters and larger impact basins). Younger craters have radial rays (produced by ejected materials)  \n**Common features:** The most common features are craters. Most craters were formed soon after the Solar System formed and still had many small bodies in space. Craters are rare on surfaces that have been resurfaced recently, because resurfacing removes or buries craters. Resurfacing processes include volcanic plains, fluvial erosion and sedimentation, and subduction by plate tectonics.  \n**Rare/Special Features:** Features not found in many other places, they may be caused by very specific atmospheric/climate conditions or a remnant of an unusual event in the bodies past.  \n**Life limiting parameter:** Life should be able to grow and reproduce. Life may be limited by below freezing or above boiling temperatures, lack of atmosphere, lack of water or lack of magnetosphere (magnetospheres protect bodies from dangerous radiation in solar winds).  \n**Nomenclature (Naming):** Placenames can be proposed by the scientists who study a region or feature and it is approved by the working group of the International Astronomical Union\u2019s specialized to planetary placenames. Each feature type and each body has a particular theme (for example, gods of fire for Io) and the generic terms (like Mountain) are in Latin language to ensure language-neutrality. This also follows the geographic traditions of the 1600s when the first maps of the Moons were created in Europe with Latin names.  \n**Age:** Age of the surface. Many craters on the surface indicates an old surface age (4 billion years old), fewer craters indicates a younger surface age (0-3 billion years old). In the early solar system (c. 4 billion years ago) there were many small objects that could impact on the bodies causing craters. Later on, there were far fewer objects as they had impacted onto the planets or been moved away by their gravitational fields.  \n\n**Shapes of geologic features:**  \n**Circular:** usually an impact crater, occasionally a volcanic caldera  \n**Linear (straight):** negative elevation = tectonic fracture, positive elevation = dune, ridge or mountain  \n**Sinuous:** river or lava channel  \n**Lobate:** water rich impact crater, ejecta (debris thrown out by an impact or volcano), glacier, landslide  \n**Radial:** impact crater ray  \n**Concentric:** impact crater ring  \n\n\nEarth for comparison:\n(MAP: use http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html for Earth map or Google map).\n\n**Body type:** planet  \n**Body composition:** rocky  \n**Atmosphere:** just right   \n**Liquid:** water  \n**Endogenic features:** volcanoes, faults. Plate tectonics is unique to Earth.  \n**Exogenic features:** rivers, lakes, dunes, floodplains, deltas, glaciers. Glacial features on Earth are not permanent, most of the time there is no ice cap on Earth.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** 100+ impact craters, many buried or eroded due to erosion, or destroyed by plate tectonics (subduction), or impacted into water without permanent crater.  \n**Common features:** oceans, mountains, plains, rivers  \n**Rare features:** glaciers  \n**Life limiting parameter:** where it is too dry (no liquid water - deserts), too cold (no liquid water \u2013 Antarctica)  \n**Age:** mostly very young, some as old as 1 billion years.   \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/356491c3-1cde-42b6-acae-8a7cb26bfe16/olympus.jpg)\nSize comparison of the highest mountains on Earth and Olympus Mons on Mars\n", "fulldesc": "The teacher should have the map of Venus either printed in a size that is still readable and accessible physically for the students, or projected onto a canvas at full resolution. \n\nFrom this step you can choose one or several of the following subtopics designed to a teacher-instructed structured classroom activity with or without the handouts or you can follow the handout in itself. The instructions for the activities are also shown on the handout.\n\nRead Page 1 of the handout with students, asking them to underline any words they do not understand so you can explain them.\n\n###CARTOGRAPHY \n\nShow the map to the class and ask the students why the map representation of the body is circular (e.g., the planet is a spherical body). Now ask why there are two circle (hemisphere)-maps shown on the map. Explain that a sphere is represented by two circular projections, and those are the two sides of the one single sphere. We call one western (left), the other eastern (right) hemisphere. \n\n**Activity 1: **\n- Draw the Equator (a horizontal line in the middle of the two circles), \n- Mark the poles (in both hemispheres) and \n- Write the name of the body as a map title. \n\nCompare the cartographic representation with real photograph. (SEE HANDOUT FIGURE ONE) Ask about the differences between the two pictures. Cartographic generalization (simplification) has been used and extra emphasis placed on the important but not necessarily visually prominent features. For planets with opaque atmosphere, the surface is not visible on the photo. Map colors may be different from real colors. Which elements are not on the photo that are present on the map? Why are those elements needed? (NOTE: Alien Creatures are NOT REAL).\n\n###GEOLOGY\nAsk the class what geological information (about the landforms) they can see on the map. Name at least one such feature type (See Activity 2 on the handout for a list of them).\n\nIdentify/find endogenic landforms that were produced by magma from below the surface (volcanic landforms: volcanoes, lava flows, tectonic landforms: cracks, fractures). \nIdentify /find exogenic landforms that were produced by processes that operate on the surface in a planet with atmosphere (wind: dunes, deserts, water: weathering, rivers, oceans, lakes, sediments).\nIdentify /find cosmogenic landforms that were produced by impact processes (impact craters or impact basins made by asteroids or comets coming from outer space).\n\n**Activity 2** - Graphic map. Using the map, draw a generalized (simplified) sketch map, showing the outlines of only the largest and most important features (draw several types of features, e.g., cracks and craters). You can use colors and/or lines. \nTry to include the following featurs:\n**Tectonic** (fractures in brittle crust)  \n- Approx. outlines of high standing continents  (Ishtar Terra, Aphrodite Terra)  \n- Highest mountain range / peak in Maxwell Montes  \n- Long crack (trough, graben) of Devana Chasma, Artemis Chasma, the chasms of Atla Regio  \n**Volcanic** (molten magma)  \n- The long lava channel of Baltis Vallis  \n- Volcanic shields (... Mons) in Atla Regio and \nSouth of Ishtar terra  \n- In general, all other terrains are lava flows, generally with lots of very small volccanic cones  \n- Cricular coronae in the Western hemisphere\n**Most famous landers:** Venera 9, Venera 10  \n\n\n###EXPLORATION\n\nAsk students where would they land / build a settlement(s) for more exploration? Which region (or feature) is worth more exploration?  Why? What do you want to investigate? What instruments/tools/methods would you use for the investigation? What would you bring with you for this research?\n\n**Activity 3** - Your landing site. Where would you land? Which place you find the most exciting for exploration? Find YOUR landing site. Mark it with a symbol. Name your landing site (s). Write down the names next to the symbol.\n\n###TOPONYMY\nAsk students to read one name from the map aloud.  Ask what they understand from them, i.e. what the names tell them. The names are in Latin as the planets are not part of any country and Latin is considered a neutral international language. Ask students if they like this \u201cneutral\u201d (Latin) naming or name in English (or your language) would be better. You may explain the meaning of the names on the map. You can find the English equivalents in this site: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n\n**Activity 4** - Names. After the graphic part is finished, create the nomenclature: write the names of the features you have drawn next to the feature itself. Write three names (you can add more later) onto the map. You can use different colors or letters for each feature type (e.g, capital letters for continents, red color for the lava channel etc. -- be consistent).\n\n###ASTRONOMY, CLIMATOLOGY, METEOROLOGY\nAsk students if there is atmosphere on the planet and why they think this\n\nFind weather data (max/min surface temperature) on the map control board or on the handout. Do not confuse coordinate values (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 etc.) shown on the map with temperature values shown on the control board. \n\nAsk students if there is liquid water or other liquid material on the planet and how do they know that. Compare local temperature ranges (max-min) with freezing / boiling temperature of water. What is the chance of finding liquid water? \n\n**Activity 5** - Weather forecast for \"tomorrow\", based on the Weather information in the handout. Choose at least three places, and show weather data: display the min/max temperature in your unit (C or F) with LARGE numbers. Consider that on towards the poles it is colder. Next to the numbers, show the weather with a graphic symbol you design: clear (sunny), cloudy, rainy, foggy or any interesting, special weather phenomenon you learn from the handout. Find min/max temperature data on the map's control desk and additional information on the handout.\n\nAsk students what protective clothing they would need if they were to explore the surface away from their vehicles, using the values discussed previously. For example, they may need oxygen tanks, a suit that maintains room temperature, pressure etc.\n\n**Activity 6** - Design a flag for Venus, and draw it on the map, based on the characteristics of the body (weather, color, geology etc).\n\nAsk students if the creatures, or plants or animals would survive on Venus, using the values given in the control panel (temperature, pressure \u2013 use the concept of liquid water = habitability: if liquid water can exits, life may (or may not) exist). Explain that no present life forms or traces of past life have ever been discovered on any other planet or moon in the Solar System or outside it on exoplanets, however, there are millions of planets never explored by us. What kind of creatures could exist there? What protection / skills would they need for survival? What would they look like? (e.g., thick fur, or underground animals etc.). What would they eat? How would they communicate with each other? (For example, without air, no sound exist).  \n\n###LEGEND\n**Activity 7** \u2013 Draw a legend where YOUR symbols are explained on the map. You may group them by process (e.g., exogenic (atmospheric, aeolian), endogenic (volcanic, tectonic) and impact processes). Write down the title \u201cLEGEND\u201d and explain your symbols and indicate which feature it corresponds to.\n\n**Homework:** Ask students to compose or draw stories using the map\u2019s landscapes as background for the story, and their creatures as the characters of the story. A possible storyline: how the surface became like what it is now? (as told with a story, not scientifically).  You can also Illustrate the story. \n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "The language of the maps and accompanying texts about various bodies is translated to 11 languages so if a teacher speaks English, he or she can use materials of this activity in the following languages:\nPresently the Pluto map is only offered in English.\n \nEnglish https://childrensmaps.wordpress.com/ \nFrench, http://cartespourenfants.wordpress.com/ \nGerman, http://kartenfuerkinder.wordpress.com/ \nHungarian,  http://gyerekterkep.wordpress.com/ \nItalian, http://mappeperbambini.wordpress.com/ \nPolish, https://mapydladzieci.wordpress.com/ \nPortuguese, http://mapasparacriancas.wordpress.com/ \nRomani (Gipsy) http://mapileshavorenge.wordpress.com/ \nRomanian, http://hartipentrucopii.wordpress.com/ \nRussian, http://kartydlyadetey.wordpress.com/ \nSpanish, http://mapasparaninos.wordpress.com/ \n\n", "conclusion": "Using planetary maps, students will be able to read cartographic information and compare the environmental conditions of Venus to those Earth.

On Mars, scientists are looking for places where life could have developed in the past or may have survived in geologic refuges (caves, in the subsurface, within rocks, water-containing layers etc.). This is why NASA was looking for signs of water. Now that water (ice) containing sites and geologic units have been identified, they are searching for signs of past or present life. Europa may have a subsurface ocean that is exposed to space in new fractures. Scientist today are looking for life forms that are based on the same materials as terrestrial life, i.e. carbon-based life that relies on water, so they are looking for places where water can exist in liquid form. Other forms of life may exist, however as we do not know about them or how to identify them, the main focus is searching for identifiable carbon-based life.\n\n**About space programs:** In addition to search for life, or bodies and regions that are habitable for terrestrial-like life, space programs are also motivated by the competition between countries. Space exploration also helps understand the geological processes on our planet and Earth\u2019s past and future. For example, the intense greenhouse effect on Venus can help predict similar processes in Earth\u2019s future or impact craters show how the Earth looked like 4 billion years ago. One of the most unexpected results of the Apollo program that sent humans on to the Moon was the so-called \u201coverview effect\u201d: this was the first \u2013 and so far, last \u2013 time when human eyes saw our planet as a fragile \u201cblue marble\u201d against the black space that changed our perception of our world and our place in the universe. \n\n**About space research:** Individual scientists can do research on a single landform for years, trying to explain how and when it formed. Others map specific regions in detail and classify the features seen on the maps. After a scientist publishes the results of the research, it becomes a little brick in the large building of planetary science and other scientists can use these results to improve their surface evolution models or can use these results in their own research. \nMost of the content shown on these maps were obtained in the last decades, in some cases, only in recent years. The formation of some landforms is still not fully understood. \n\n###General descriptions of parameters that could be discussed when characterizing the chosen planet or moon.\n\n**Body type:** Planet or moon. Planets orbit the Sun, moons orbit a planet. One side of a moon generally always faces its planet (tidally locked).  \n**Body composition:** Rocky bodies are made of silicate rocks (example Earth). Icy bodies are made of a rock and H2O ice mixture but their surfaces are usually mostly ice (example: Europa). On these worlds mountains and plains are made of rock-hard ice. Icy bodies occur only in the colder Outer Solar System.  \n**Atmosphere:** Atmospheres only occur if the gravity (and size) of the body is sufficient to hold gas molecules. It is easier to hold a gas molecule if it is colder.  \n**Liquid:** Liquids may be water in the inner Solar System or methane-ethane-nitrogen in the Outer Solar System. Liquids only occur where there is an atmosphere that produces air pressure. If air pressure is too low, liquid molecules evaporate/sublimate. If temperature is too low, liquids freeze. If temperature is too high, liquids evaporate. Water may exist underground. \n**Weather:** Diurnal temperature range (changes in temperature due to day and night) and forms of precipitation.  \n**Endogenic features:** Features produced by forces in the interior of the planet. **Volcanism** requires molten interior. Heat is provided from planetary formation (impact / accretion heat) or the irreversible decay of radioactive elements. Small bodies cool quicker than large bodies, so volcanism is found only on larger planets. An exception is if the interior is continuously heated. This happens inside moons on elliptic orbits where tidal forces produce interior heat (e.g. Io).  **Tectonic** features are caused by stresses in the brittle crust.  Tectonic forces produce fractures during earthquakes. This requires movements within the planet, also driven by internal heat. Volcanoes grow upward by adding more lava but may collapse and produce crater-like caldera. \n**Exogenic features:** Features produced by processes on the surface or atmosphere. Includes aeolian (wind), fluvial (river), lacustrine (lake), oceanic features and their deposits.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** Features produced by impacting bodies (smaller craters and larger impact basins). Younger craters have radial rays (produced by ejected materials)  \n**Common features:** The most common features are craters. Most craters were formed soon after the Solar System formed and still had many small bodies in space. Craters are rare on surfaces that have been resurfaced recently, because resurfacing removes or buries craters. Resurfacing processes include volcanic plains, fluvial erosion and sedimentation, and subduction by plate tectonics.  \n**Rare/Special Features:** Features not found in many other places, they may be caused by very specific atmospheric/climate conditions or a remnant of an unusual event in the bodies past.  \n**Life limiting parameter:** Life should be able to grow and reproduce. Life may be limited by below freezing or above boiling temperatures, lack of atmosphere, lack of water or lack of magnetosphere (magnetospheres protect bodies from dangerous radiation in solar winds).  \n**Nomenclature (Naming):** Placenames can be proposed by the scientists who study a region or feature and it is approved by the working group of the International Astronomical Union\u2019s specialized to planetary placenames. Each feature type and each body has a particular theme (for example, gods of fire for Io) and the generic terms (like Mountain) are in Latin language to ensure language-neutrality. This also follows the geographic traditions of the 1600s when the first maps of the Moons were created in Europe with Latin names.  \n**Age:** Age of the surface. Many craters on the surface indicates an old surface age (4 billion years old), fewer craters indicates a younger surface age (0-3 billion years old). In the early solar system (c. 4 billion years ago) there were many small objects that could impact on the bodies causing craters. Later on, there were far fewer objects as they had impacted onto the planets or been moved away by their gravitational fields.  \n\n**Shapes of geologic features:**  \n**Circular:** usually an impact crater, occasionally a volcanic caldera  \n**Linear (straight):** negative elevation = tectonic fracture, positive elevation = dune, ridge or mountain  \n**Sinuous:** river or lava channel  \n**Lobate:** water rich impact crater, ejecta (debris thrown out by an impact or volcano), glacier, landslide  \n**Radial:** impact crater ray  \n**Concentric:** impact crater ring  \n\n\nEarth for comparison:\n(MAP: use http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html for Earth map or Google map).\n\n**Body type:** planet  \n**Body composition:** rocky  \n**Atmosphere:** just right   \n**Liquid:** water  \n**Endogenic features:** volcanoes, faults. Plate tectonics is unique to Earth.  \n**Exogenic features:** rivers, lakes, dunes, floodplains, deltas, glaciers. Glacial features on Earth are not permanent, most of the time there is no ice cap on Earth.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** 100+ impact craters, many buried or eroded due to erosion, or destroyed by plate tectonics (subduction), or impacted into water without permanent crater.  \n**Common features:** oceans, mountains, plains, rivers  \n**Rare features:** glaciers  \n**Life limiting parameter:** where it is too dry (no liquid water - deserts), too cold (no liquid water \u2013 Antarctica)  \n**Age:** mostly very young, some as old as 1 billion years.   \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b9a1e2c3-1933-407f-9b07-f8eecca1c5ae/olympus.jpg)\nSize comparison of the highest mountains on Earth and Olympus Mons on Mars\n", "fulldesc": "The teacher should have the map of Mars either printed in a size that is still readable and accessible physically for the students, or projected onto a canvas at full resolution. \n\nFrom this step you can choose one or several of the following subtopics designed to a teacher-instructed structured classroom activity with or without the handouts or you can follow the handout in itself. The instructions for the activities are also shown on the handout.\n\nRead Page 1 of the handout with students, asking them to underline any words they do not understand so you can explain them.\n\n###CARTOGRAPHY \n\nShow the map to the class and ask the students why the map representation of the body is circular (e.g., the planet is a spherical body). Now ask why there are two circle (hemisphere)-maps shown on the map. Explain that a sphere is represented by two circular projections, and those are the two sides of the one single sphere. We call one western (left), the other eastern (right) hemisphere. \n\n**Activity 1: **\n- Draw the Equator (a horizontal line in the middle of the two circles), \n- Mark the poles (in both hemispheres) and \n- Write the name of the body as a map title. \n\nCompare the cartographic representation with real photograph. (SEE HANDOUT FIGURE ONE) Ask about the differences between the two pictures. Cartographic generalization (simplification) has been used and extra emphasis placed on the important but not necessarily visually prominent features. For planets with opaque atmosphere, the surface is not visible on the photo. Map colors may be different from real colors. Which elements are not on the photo that are present on the map? Why are those elements needed? (NOTE: Alien Creatures are NOT REAL).\n\n###GEOLOGY\nAsk the class what geological information (about the landforms) they can see on the map. Name at least one such feature type (See Activity 2 on the handout for a list of them).\n\nIdentify/find endogenic landforms that were produced by magma from below the surface (volcanic landforms: volcanoes, lava flows, tectonic landforms: cracks, fractures). \nIdentify /find exogenic landforms that were produced by processes that operate on the surface in a planet with atmosphere (wind: dunes, deserts, water: weathering, rivers, oceans, lakes, sediments).\nIdentify /find cosmogenic landforms that were produced by impact processes (impact craters or impact basins made by asteroids or comets coming from outer space).\n\n**Activity 2** - Graphic map. Using the map, draw a generalized (simplified) sketch map, showing the outlines of only the largest and most important features (draw several types of features, e.g., cracks and craters). You can use colors and/or lines. \n\nTry to include the following featurs:  \n- **Sedimentary or lava:**  \nThe northern lowlands (shown in yellow)  \n- **Impact:**  \nThe southern highlands with lots of craters (shown in orange)  \nTwo large impact basins (Argyre Planitia and Hellas Planitia)  \n- **Tectonic:**  (fractures in brittle crust)  \n- Valles Marineris trough and its channels  \n- **Volcanic:**  \nOlympus Mons and other nearby three volcanoes and  Elysium Mons volcano  \n- **Glacial:** (ice related)  \nThe two bright polar caps  \n- **Most famous landers:**   \nViking 1-2, Phoenix, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity  \n  \n\n\n###EXPLORATION\n\nAsk students where would they land / build a settlement(s) for more exploration? Which region (or feature) is worth more exploration?  Why? What do you want to investigate? What instruments/tools/methods would you use for the investigation? What would you bring with you for this research?\n\n**Activity 3** - Your landing site. Where would you land? Which place you find the most exciting for exploration? Find YOUR landing site. Mark it with a symbol. Name your landing site (s). Write down the names next to the symbol.\n\n###TOPONYMY\nAsk students to read one name from the map aloud.  Ask what they understand from them, i.e. what the names tell them. The names are in Latin as the planets are not part of any country and Latin is considered a neutral international language. Ask students if they like this \u201cneutral\u201d (Latin) naming or name in English (or your language) would be better. You may explain the meaning of the names on the map. You can find the English equivalents in this site: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n\n**Activity 4** - Names. After the graphic part is finished, create the nomenclature: write the names of the features you have drawn next to the feature itself. Write three names (you can add more later) onto the map. You can use different colors or letters for each feature type (e.g, capital letters for continents, red color for the lava channel etc. -- be consistent).\n\n###ASTRONOMY, CLIMATOLOGY, METEOROLOGY\nAsk students if there is atmosphere on the planet and why they think this\n\nFind weather data (max/min surface temperature) on the map control board or on the handout. Do not confuse coordinate values (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 etc.) shown on the map with temperature values shown on the control board. \n\nAsk students if there is liquid water or other liquid material on the planet and how do they know that. Compare local temperature ranges (max-min) with freezing / boiling temperature of water. What is the chance of finding liquid water? \n\n**Activity 5** - Weather forecast for \"tomorrow\", based on the Weather information in the handout. Choose at least three places, and show weather data: display the min/max temperature in your unit (C or F) with LARGE numbers. Consider that on towards the poles it is colder. Next to the numbers, show the weather with a graphic symbol you design: clear (sunny), cloudy, rainy, foggy or any interesting, special weather phenomenon you learn from the handout. Find min/max temperature data on the map's control desk and additional information on the handout.\n\nAsk students what protective clothing they would need if they were to explore the surface away from their vehicles, using the values discussed previously. For example, they may need oxygen tanks, a suit that maintains room temperature, pressure etc.\n\n**Activity 6** - Design a flag for Mars, and draw it on the map, based on the characteristics of the planet (weather, color, geology etc).\n\nAsk students if the creatures, or plants or animals would survive on Mars, using the values given in the control panel (temperature, pressure \u2013 use the concept of liquid water = habitability: if liquid water can exits, life may (or may not) exist). Explain that no present life forms or traces of past life have ever been discovered on any other planet or moon in the Solar System or outside it on exoplanets, however, there are millions of planets never explored by us. What kind of creatures could exist there? What protection / skills would they need for survival? What would they look like? (e.g., thick fur, or underground animals etc.). What would they eat? How would they communicate with each other? (For example, without air, no sound exist).  \n\n###LEGEND\n**Activity 7** \u2013 Draw a legend where YOUR symbols are explained on the map. You may group them by process (e.g., exogenic (atmospheric, aeolian), endogenic (volcanic, tectonic) and impact processes). Write down the title \u201cLEGEND\u201d and explain your symbols and indicate which feature it corresponds to.\n\n**Homework:** Ask students to compose or draw stories using the map\u2019s landscapes as background for the story, and their creatures as the characters of the story. A possible storyline: how the surface became like what it is now? (as told with a story, not scientifically).  You can also Illustrate the story. \n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "The language of the maps and accompanying texts about various bodies is translated to 11 languages so if a teacher speaks English, he or she can use materials of this activity in the following languages:\nPresently the Pluto map is only offered in English.\n \nEnglish https://childrensmaps.wordpress.com/ \nFrench, http://cartespourenfants.wordpress.com/ \nGerman, http://kartenfuerkinder.wordpress.com/ \nHungarian,  http://gyerekterkep.wordpress.com/ \nItalian, http://mappeperbambini.wordpress.com/ \nPolish, https://mapydladzieci.wordpress.com/ \nPortuguese, http://mapasparacriancas.wordpress.com/ \nRomani (Gipsy) http://mapileshavorenge.wordpress.com/ \nRomanian, http://hartipentrucopii.wordpress.com/ \nRussian, http://kartydlyadetey.wordpress.com/ \nSpanish, http://mapasparaninos.wordpress.com/ \n\n", "conclusion": "Using planetary maps, students will be able to read cartographic information and compare the environmental conditions of Mars to those Earth.

It is about the *geography / geology of planets*, and about how to read and make maps (cartographic representation). At elementary school level, the concept of \u201cgeography\u201d (that can be a part of the more general \u201cScience\u201d curriculum) covers basic concepts of several fields in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, for example geology, geomorphology, cartography, meteorology and climatology. We follow this concept. \n\n**What is this activity NOT about?** This activity is not a planetary science image interpretation practice. This is also not an introduction to the structure of the Solar System or Astronomy. Astronomy is a completely different discipline from planetary science. The subject of Planetology is planetary bodies, and an important part of it is called *astrogeology*, which studies the surface geology of planets and moons. This activity is an astrogeologic and planetary cartographic activity. Astronomy is about for example stars, galaxies, and the celestial motions of planets.\n\n**Cartographic problems:** The maps show the bodies in Lambert Projection (two separate hemispheric views. This requires additional explanation from the teacher on how two \u201csides\u201d of a sphere is projected into two circular views which is not therefore not the view of two different bodies). \n\n**Astrobiology:** About \u201calien\u201d creatures: On the map, every geologic feature shown is real and placed at their true position, however the living creatures are completely fictional which also requires the teacher\u2019s explanation so that the students will not think that people or \u201caliens\u201d live on planets and moons. It should be clarified that no life or sign of past life has ever been identified on any planet or moon other than on Earth. This might be a good opportunity to talk about the billions of exoplanets that exist in the universe that, unlike most extra-terrestrial Solar System planets and moons, include millions of planets and moons where conditions are much more favourable for life than extra-terrestrial worlds within our Solar System. An exciting new part of planetary science is exoplanetology, which deals with planets outside our Solar System. Many of those exoplanets and exomoons are completely different from those in our Solar System.\nThe very basis of space missions is to search for life. On Mars, scientists are looking for places where life could have developed in the past or may have survived in geologic refuges (caves, in the subsurface, within rocks, water-containing layers etc.). This is why NASA was looking for signs of water. Now that water (ice) containing sites and geologic units have been identified, they are searching for signs of past or present life. Europa may have a subsurface ocean that is exposed to space in new fractures. Scientist today are looking for life forms that are based on the same materials as terrestrial life, i.e. carbon-based life that relies on water, so they are looking for places where water can exist in liquid form. Other forms of life may exist, however as we do not know about them or how to identify them, the main focus is searching for identifiable carbon-based life.\n\n**About space programs:** In addition to search for life, or bodies and regions that are habitable for terrestrial-like life, space programs are also motivated by the competition between countries.

Why are those elements needed? (NOTE: Alien Creatures are NOT REAL).\n\n###GEOLOGY\nAsk the class what geological information (about the landforms) they can see on the map. Name at least one such feature type (See Activity 2 on the handout for a list of them).\n\nIdentify/find endogenic landforms that were produced by magma from below the surface (volcanic landforms: volcanoes, lava flows, tectonic landforms: cracks, fractures). \nIdentify /find exogenic landforms that were produced by processes that operate on the surface in a planet with atmosphere (wind: dunes, deserts, water: weathering, rivers, oceans, lakes, sediments).\nIdentify /find cosmogenic landforms that were produced by impact processes (impact craters or impact basins made by asteroids or comets coming from outer space).\n\n**Activity 2** - Graphic map. Using the map, draw a generalized (simplified) sketch map, showing the outlines of only the largest and most important features (draw several types of features, e.g., cracks and craters). You can use colors and/or lines. \nTry to include the following featurs:\n\n- **Volcanic:**  \nOutlines of the dark areas (maria, seas of solid basalt within large impact basin)  \n- **Impact**  \nBright  rayed, young craters (Tycho, Copernicus)  \nMultiring impact basins (Mare Orientale)  \nRinged craters (Schrodinger)  \n- **Most famous landers:**  \nApollo 11\u201317\n\n\n###EXPLORATION\n\nAsk students where would they land / build a settlement(s) for more exploration? Which region (or feature) is worth more exploration?  Why? What do you want to investigate? What instruments/tools/methods would you use for the investigation? What would you bring with you for this research?\n\n**Activity 3** - Your landing site. Where would you land? Which place you find the most exciting for exploration? Find YOUR landing site. Mark it with a symbol. Name your landing site (s). Write down the names next to the symbol.\n\n###TOPONYMY\nAsk students to read one name from the map aloud.  Ask what they understand from them, i.e. what the names tell them. The names are in Latin as the planets are not part of any country and Latin is considered a neutral international language. Ask students if they like this \u201cneutral\u201d (Latin) naming or name in English (or your language) would be better. You may explain the meaning of the names on the map. You can find the English equivalents in this site: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n\n**Activity 4** - Names. After the graphic part is finished, create the nomenclature: write the names of the features you have drawn next to the feature itself. Write three names (you can add more later) onto the map. You can use different colors or letters for each feature type (e.g, capital letters for continents, red color for the lava channel etc. -- be consistent).\n\n###ASTRONOMY, CLIMATOLOGY, METEOROLOGY\nAsk students if there is atmosphere on the planet and why they think this\n\nFind weather data (max/min surface temperature) on the map control board or on the handout. Do not confuse coordinate values (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 etc.) shown on the map with temperature values shown on the control board. \n\nAsk students if there is liquid water or other liquid material on the planet and how do they know that. Compare local temperature ranges (max-min) with freezing / boiling temperature of water. What is the chance of finding liquid water? \n\n**Activity 5** - Weather forecast for \"tomorrow\", based on the Weather information in the handout. Choose at least three places, and show weather data: display the min/max temperature in your unit (C or F) with LARGE numbers. Consider that on towards the poles it is colder. Next to the numbers, show the weather with a graphic symbol you design: clear (sunny), cloudy, rainy, foggy or any interesting, special weather phenomenon you learn from the handout. Find min/max temperature data on the map's control desk and additional information on the handout.\n\nAsk students what protective clothing they would need if they were to explore the surface away from their vehicles, using the values discussed previously. For example, they may need oxygen tanks, a suit that maintains room temperature, pressure etc.\n\n**Activity 6** - Design a flag for The Moon, and draw it on the map, based on the characteristics of the body (weather, color, geology etc).\n\nAsk students if the creatures, or plants or animals would survive on The Moon, using the values given in the control panel (temperature, pressure \u2013 use the concept of liquid water = habitability: if liquid water can exits, life may (or may not) exist). Explain that no present life forms or traces of past life have ever been discovered on any other planet or moon in the Solar System or outside it on exoplanets, however, there are millions of planets never explored by us. What kind of creatures could exist there? What protection / skills would they need for survival? What would they look like? (e.g., thick fur, or underground animals etc.). What would they eat? How would they communicate with each other? (For example, without air, no sound exist).  \n\n###LEGEND\n**Activity 7** \u2013 Draw a legend where YOUR symbols are explained on the map. You may group them by process (e.g., exogenic (atmospheric, aeolian), endogenic (volcanic, tectonic) and impact processes). Write down the title \u201cLEGEND\u201d and explain your symbols and indicate which feature it corresponds to.\n\n**Homework:** Ask students to compose or draw stories using the map\u2019s landscapes as background for the story, and their creatures as the characters of the story. A possible storyline: how the surface became like what it is now? (as told with a story, not scientifically).  You can also Illustrate the story. \n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "The language of the maps and accompanying texts about various bodies is translated to 11 languages so if a teacher speaks English, he or she can use materials of this activity in the following languages:\nPresently the Pluto map is only offered in English.\n \nEnglish https://childrensmaps.wordpress.com/ \nFrench, http://cartespourenfants.wordpress.com/ \nGerman, http://kartenfuerkinder.wordpress.com/ \nHungarian,  http://gyerekterkep.wordpress.com/ \nItalian, http://mappeperbambini.wordpress.com/ \nPolish, https://mapydladzieci.wordpress.com/ \nPortuguese, http://mapasparacriancas.wordpress.com/ \nRomani (Gipsy) http://mapileshavorenge.wordpress.com/ \nRomanian, http://hartipentrucopii.wordpress.com/ \nRussian, http://kartydlyadetey.wordpress.com/ \nSpanish, http://mapasparaninos.wordpress.com/ \n\n", "conclusion": "Using planetary maps, students will be able to read cartographic information and compare the environmental conditions of The Moon to those Earth.

It is about the *geography / geology of planets*, and about how to read and make maps (cartographic representation). At elementary school level, the concept of \u201cgeography\u201d (that can be a part of the more general \u201cScience\u201d curriculum) covers basic concepts of several fields in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, for example geology, geomorphology, cartography, meteorology and climatology. We follow this concept. \n\n**What is this activity NOT about?** This activity is not a planetary science image interpretation practice. This is also not an introduction to the structure of the Solar System or Astronomy. Astronomy is a completely different discipline from planetary science. The subject of Planetology is planetary bodies, and an important part of it is called *astrogeology*, which studies the surface geology of planets and moons. This activity is an astrogeologic and planetary cartographic activity. Astronomy is about for example stars, galaxies, and the celestial motions of planets.\n\n**Cartographic problems:** The maps show the bodies in Lambert Projection (two separate hemispheric views. This requires additional explanation from the teacher on how two \u201csides\u201d of a sphere is projected into two circular views which is not therefore not the view of two different bodies). \n\n**Astrobiology:** About \u201calien\u201d creatures: On the map, every geologic feature shown is real and placed at their true position, however the living creatures are completely fictional which also requires the teacher\u2019s explanation so that the students will not think that people or \u201caliens\u201d live on planets and moons. It should be clarified that no life or sign of past life has ever been identified on any planet or moon other than on Earth. This might be a good opportunity to talk about the billions of exoplanets that exist in the universe that, unlike most extra-terrestrial Solar System planets and moons, include millions of planets and moons where conditions are much more favourable for life than extra-terrestrial worlds within our Solar System. An exciting new part of planetary science is exoplanetology, which deals with planets outside our Solar System. Many of those exoplanets and exomoons are completely different from those in our Solar System.\nThe very basis of space missions is to search for life. On Mars, scientists are looking for places where life could have developed in the past or may have survived in geologic refuges (caves, in the subsurface, within rocks, water-containing layers etc.). This is why NASA was looking for signs of water. Now that water (ice) containing sites and geologic units have been identified, they are searching for signs of past or present life. Europa may have a subsurface ocean that is exposed to space in new fractures. Scientist today are looking for life forms that are based on the same materials as terrestrial life, i.e. carbon-based life that relies on water, so they are looking for places where water can exist in liquid form. Other forms of life may exist, however as we do not know about them or how to identify them, the main focus is searching for identifiable carbon-based life.\n\n**About space programs:** In addition to search for life, or bodies and regions that are habitable for terrestrial-like life, space programs are also motivated by the competition between countries. Space exploration also helps understand the geological processes on our planet and Earth\u2019s past and future. For example, the intense greenhouse effect on Venus can help predict similar processes in Earth\u2019s future or impact craters show how the Earth looked like 4 billion years ago. One of the most unexpected results of the Apollo program that sent humans on to the Moon was the so-called \u201coverview effect\u201d: this was the first \u2013 and so far, last \u2013 time when human eyes saw our planet as a fragile \u201cblue marble\u201d against the black space that changed our perception of our world and our place in the universe. \n\n**About space research:** Individual scientists can do research on a single landform for years, trying to explain how and when it formed. Others map specific regions in detail and classify the features seen on the maps. After a scientist publishes the results of the research, it becomes a little brick in the large building of planetary science and other scientists can use these results to improve their surface evolution models or can use these results in their own research. \nMost of the content shown on these maps were obtained in the last decades, in some cases, only in recent years. The formation of some landforms is still not fully understood. \n\n###General descriptions of parameters that could be discussed when characterizing the chosen planet or moon.\n\n**Body type:** Planet or moon. Planets orbit the Sun, moons orbit a planet. One side of a moon generally always faces its planet (tidally locked).  \n**Body composition:** Rocky bodies are made of silicate rocks (example Earth). Icy bodies are made of a rock and H2O ice mixture but their surfaces are usually mostly ice (example: Europa). On these worlds mountains and plains are made of rock-hard ice. Icy bodies occur only in the colder Outer Solar System.  \n**Atmosphere:** Atmospheres only occur if the gravity (and size) of the body is sufficient to hold gas molecules. It is easier to hold a gas molecule if it is colder.  \n**Liquid:** Liquids may be water in the inner Solar System or methane-ethane-nitrogen in the Outer Solar System. Liquids only occur where there is an atmosphere that produces air pressure. If air pressure is too low, liquid molecules evaporate/sublimate. If temperature is too low, liquids freeze. If temperature is too high, liquids evaporate. Water may exist underground. \n**Weather:** Diurnal temperature range (changes in temperature due to day and night) and forms of precipitation.  \n**Endogenic features:** Features produced by forces in the interior of the planet. **Volcanism** requires molten interior. Heat is provided from planetary formation (impact / accretion heat) or the irreversible decay of radioactive elements. Small bodies cool quicker than large bodies, so volcanism is found only on larger planets. An exception is if the interior is continuously heated. This happens inside moons on elliptic orbits where tidal forces produce interior heat (e.g. Io).  **Tectonic** features are caused by stresses in the brittle crust.  Tectonic forces produce fractures during earthquakes. This requires movements within the planet, also driven by internal heat. Volcanoes grow upward by adding more lava but may collapse and produce crater-like caldera. \n**Exogenic features:** Features produced by processes on the surface or atmosphere. Includes aeolian (wind), fluvial (river), lacustrine (lake), oceanic features and their deposits.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** Features produced by impacting bodies (smaller craters and larger impact basins). Younger craters have radial rays (produced by ejected materials)  \n**Common features:** The most common features are craters. Most craters were formed soon after the Solar System formed and still had many small bodies in space. Craters are rare on surfaces that have been resurfaced recently, because resurfacing removes or buries craters. Resurfacing processes include volcanic plains, fluvial erosion and sedimentation, and subduction by plate tectonics.  \n**Rare/Special Features:** Features not found in many other places, they may be caused by very specific atmospheric/climate conditions or a remnant of an unusual event in the bodies past.  \n**Life limiting parameter:** Life should be able to grow and reproduce. Life may be limited by below freezing or above boiling temperatures, lack of atmosphere, lack of water or lack of magnetosphere (magnetospheres protect bodies from dangerous radiation in solar winds).  \n**Nomenclature (Naming):** Placenames can be proposed by the scientists who study a region or feature and it is approved by the working group of the International Astronomical Union\u2019s specialized to planetary placenames. Each feature type and each body has a particular theme (for example, gods of fire for Io) and the generic terms (like Mountain) are in Latin language to ensure language-neutrality. This also follows the geographic traditions of the 1600s when the first maps of the Moons were created in Europe with Latin names.  \n**Age:** Age of the surface. Many craters on the surface indicates an old surface age (4 billion years old), fewer craters indicates a younger surface age (0-3 billion years old). In the early solar system (c. 4 billion years ago) there were many small objects that could impact on the bodies causing craters. Later on, there were far fewer objects as they had impacted onto the planets or been moved away by their gravitational fields.  \n\n**Shapes of geologic features:**  \n**Circular:** usually an impact crater, occasionally a volcanic caldera  \n**Linear (straight):** negative elevation = tectonic fracture, positive elevation = dune, ridge or mountain  \n**Sinuous:** river or lava channel  \n**Lobate:** water rich impact crater, ejecta (debris thrown out by an impact or volcano), glacier, landslide  \n**Radial:** impact crater ray  \n**Concentric:** impact crater ring  \n\n\nEarth for comparison:\n(MAP: use http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html for Earth map or Google map).\n\n**Body type:** planet  \n**Body composition:** rocky  \n**Atmosphere:** just right   \n**Liquid:** water  \n**Endogenic features:** volcanoes, faults. Plate tectonics is unique to Earth.  \n**Exogenic features:** rivers, lakes, dunes, floodplains, deltas, glaciers. Glacial features on Earth are not permanent, most of the time there is no ice cap on Earth.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** 100+ impact craters, many buried or eroded due to erosion, or destroyed by plate tectonics (subduction), or impacted into water without permanent crater.  \n**Common features:** oceans, mountains, plains, rivers  \n**Rare features:** glaciers  \n**Life limiting parameter:** where it is too dry (no liquid water - deserts), too cold (no liquid water \u2013 Antarctica)  \n**Age:** mostly very young, some as old as 1 billion years.   \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/758bb76a-3998-4f20-bbb3-99510b5d7287/olympus.jpg)\nSize comparison of the highest mountains on Earth and Olympus Mons on Mars\n", "fulldesc": "The teacher should have the map of Io either printed in a size that is still readable and accessible physically for the students, or projected onto a canvas at full resolution. \n\nFrom this step you can choose one or several of the following subtopics designed to a teacher-instructed structured classroom activity with or without the handouts or you can follow the handout in itself. The instructions for the activities are also shown on the handout.\n\nRead Page 1 of the handout with students, asking them to underline any words they do not understand so you can explain them.\n\n###CARTOGRAPHY \n\nShow the map to the class and ask the students why the map representation of the body is circular (e.g., the planet is a spherical body). Now ask why there are two circle (hemisphere)-maps shown on the map. Explain that a sphere is represented by two circular projections, and those are the two sides of the one single sphere. We call one western (left), the other eastern (right) hemisphere. \n\n**Activity 1: **\n- Draw the Equator (a horizontal line in the middle of the two circles), \n- Mark the poles (in both hemispheres) and \n- Write the name of the body as a map title. \n\nCompare the cartographic representation with real photograph. (SEE HANDOUT FIGURE ONE) Ask about the differences between the two pictures. Cartographic generalization (simplification) has been used and extra emphasis placed on the important but not necessarily visually prominent features. For planets with opaque atmosphere, the surface is not visible on the photo. Map colors may be different from real colors. Which elements are not on the photo that are present on the map? Why are those elements needed? (NOTE: Alien Creatures are NOT REAL).\n\n###GEOLOGY\nAsk the class what geological information (about the landforms) they can see on the map.

Using the map, draw a generalized (simplified) sketch map, showing the outlines of only the largest and most important features (draw several types of features, e.g., cracks and craters). You can use colors and/or lines. \nTry to include the following featurs:  \n\n- **Volcanic:**  \nTwo major active volcanoes with plumes and deposit rings: Pele, Prometheus  \nNumerous calderas filled with lava, e.g., Loki Patera and other \"Patera\"  \n- **Tectonic:** (fractures in brittle crust)   \nMountain blocks: Haemus Montes, Boosaule Montes and other \"Mons\"  \n- **Deposits**  \nBright sulphur frost covered regions (e.g., Bactria Regio)   \nIn other places: lava flows coated by yellow sulphurous deposit  \n \n\n\n###EXPLORATION\n\nAsk students where would they land / build a settlement(s) for more exploration? Which region (or feature) is worth more exploration?  Why? What do you want to investigate? What instruments/tools/methods would you use for the investigation? What would you bring with you for this research?\n\n**Activity 3** - Your landing site. Where would you land? Which place you find the most exciting for exploration? Find YOUR landing site.

It is about the *geography / geology of planets*, and about how to read and make maps (cartographic representation). At elementary school level, the concept of \u201cgeography\u201d (that can be a part of the more general \u201cScience\u201d curriculum) covers basic concepts of several fields in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, for example geology, geomorphology, cartography, meteorology and climatology. We follow this concept. \n\n**What is this activity NOT about?** This activity is not a planetary science image interpretation practice. This is also not an introduction to the structure of the Solar System or Astronomy. Astronomy is a completely different discipline from planetary science. The subject of Planetology is planetary bodies, and an important part of it is called *astrogeology*, which studies the surface geology of planets and moons. This activity is an astrogeologic and planetary cartographic activity. Astronomy is about for example stars, galaxies, and the celestial motions of planets.\n\n**Cartographic problems:** The maps show the bodies in Lambert Projection (two separate hemispheric views. This requires additional explanation from the teacher on how two \u201csides\u201d of a sphere is projected into two circular views which is not therefore not the view of two different bodies). \n\n**Astrobiology:** About \u201calien\u201d creatures: On the map, every geologic feature shown is real and placed at their true position, however the living creatures are completely fictional which also requires the teacher\u2019s explanation so that the students will not think that people or \u201caliens\u201d live on planets and moons. It should be clarified that no life or sign of past life has ever been identified on any planet or moon other than on Earth. This might be a good opportunity to talk about the billions of exoplanets that exist in the universe that, unlike most extra-terrestrial Solar System planets and moons, include millions of planets and moons where conditions are much more favourable for life than extra-terrestrial worlds within our Solar System. An exciting new part of planetary science is exoplanetology, which deals with planets outside our Solar System. Many of those exoplanets and exomoons are completely different from those in our Solar System.\nThe very basis of space missions is to search for life. On Mars, scientists are looking for places where life could have developed in the past or may have survived in geologic refuges (caves, in the subsurface, within rocks, water-containing layers etc.). This is why NASA was looking for signs of water. Now that water (ice) containing sites and geologic units have been identified, they are searching for signs of past or present life. Europa may have a subsurface ocean that is exposed to space in new fractures. Scientist today are looking for life forms that are based on the same materials as terrestrial life, i.e. carbon-based life that relies on water, so they are looking for places where water can exist in liquid form. Other forms of life may exist, however as we do not know about them or how to identify them, the main focus is searching for identifiable carbon-based life.\n\n**About space programs:** In addition to search for life, or bodies and regions that are habitable for terrestrial-like life, space programs are also motivated by the competition between countries. Space exploration also helps understand the geological processes on our planet and Earth\u2019s past and future. For example, the intense greenhouse effect on Venus can help predict similar processes in Earth\u2019s future or impact craters show how the Earth looked like 4 billion years ago. One of the most unexpected results of the Apollo program that sent humans on to the Moon was the so-called \u201coverview effect\u201d: this was the first \u2013 and so far, last \u2013 time when human eyes saw our planet as a fragile \u201cblue marble\u201d against the black space that changed our perception of our world and our place in the universe. \n\n**About space research:** Individual scientists can do research on a single landform for years, trying to explain how and when it formed. Others map specific regions in detail and classify the features seen on the maps. After a scientist publishes the results of the research, it becomes a little brick in the large building of planetary science and other scientists can use these results to improve their surface evolution models or can use these results in their own research. \nMost of the content shown on these maps were obtained in the last decades, in some cases, only in recent years. The formation of some landforms is still not fully understood. \n\n###General descriptions of parameters that could be discussed when characterizing the chosen planet or moon.\n\n**Body type:** Planet or moon. Planets orbit the Sun, moons orbit a planet. One side of a moon generally always faces its planet (tidally locked).  \n**Body composition:** Rocky bodies are made of silicate rocks (example Earth). Icy bodies are made of a rock and H2O ice mixture but their surfaces are usually mostly ice (example: Europa). On these worlds mountains and plains are made of rock-hard ice. Icy bodies occur only in the colder Outer Solar System.  \n**Atmosphere:** Atmospheres only occur if the gravity (and size) of the body is sufficient to hold gas molecules. It is easier to hold a gas molecule if it is colder.  \n**Liquid:** Liquids may be water in the inner Solar System or methane-ethane-nitrogen in the Outer Solar System. Liquids only occur where there is an atmosphere that produces air pressure. If air pressure is too low, liquid molecules evaporate/sublimate. If temperature is too low, liquids freeze. If temperature is too high, liquids evaporate. Water may exist underground. \n**Weather:** Diurnal temperature range (changes in temperature due to day and night) and forms of precipitation.  \n**Endogenic features:** Features produced by forces in the interior of the planet. **Volcanism** requires molten interior. Heat is provided from planetary formation (impact / accretion heat) or the irreversible decay of radioactive elements. Small bodies cool quicker than large bodies, so volcanism is found only on larger planets. An exception is if the interior is continuously heated. This happens inside moons on elliptic orbits where tidal forces produce interior heat (e.g. Io).  **Tectonic** features are caused by stresses in the brittle crust.  Tectonic forces produce fractures during earthquakes. This requires movements within the planet, also driven by internal heat. Volcanoes grow upward by adding more lava but may collapse and produce crater-like caldera. \n**Exogenic features:** Features produced by processes on the surface or atmosphere. Includes aeolian (wind), fluvial (river), lacustrine (lake), oceanic features and their deposits.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** Features produced by impacting bodies (smaller craters and larger impact basins). Younger craters have radial rays (produced by ejected materials)  \n**Common features:** The most common features are craters. Most craters were formed soon after the Solar System formed and still had many small bodies in space. Craters are rare on surfaces that have been resurfaced recently, because resurfacing removes or buries craters. Resurfacing processes include volcanic plains, fluvial erosion and sedimentation, and subduction by plate tectonics.  \n**Rare/Special Features:** Features not found in many other places, they may be caused by very specific atmospheric/climate conditions or a remnant of an unusual event in the bodies past.  \n**Life limiting parameter:** Life should be able to grow and reproduce. Life may be limited by below freezing or above boiling temperatures, lack of atmosphere, lack of water or lack of magnetosphere (magnetospheres protect bodies from dangerous radiation in solar winds).  \n**Nomenclature (Naming):** Placenames can be proposed by the scientists who study a region or feature and it is approved by the working group of the International Astronomical Union\u2019s specialized to planetary placenames. Each feature type and each body has a particular theme (for example, gods of fire for Io) and the generic terms (like Mountain) are in Latin language to ensure language-neutrality. This also follows the geographic traditions of the 1600s when the first maps of the Moons were created in Europe with Latin names.  \n**Age:** Age of the surface. Many craters on the surface indicates an old surface age (4 billion years old), fewer craters indicates a younger surface age (0-3 billion years old). In the early solar system (c. 4 billion years ago) there were many small objects that could impact on the bodies causing craters. Later on, there were far fewer objects as they had impacted onto the planets or been moved away by their gravitational fields.  \n\n**Shapes of geologic features:**  \n**Circular:** usually an impact crater, occasionally a volcanic caldera  \n**Linear (straight):** negative elevation = tectonic fracture, positive elevation = dune, ridge or mountain  \n**Sinuous:** river or lava channel  \n**Lobate:** water rich impact crater, ejecta (debris thrown out by an impact or volcano), glacier, landslide  \n**Radial:** impact crater ray  \n**Concentric:** impact crater ring  \n\n\nEarth for comparison:\n(MAP: use http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html for Earth map or Google map).\n\n**Body type:** planet  \n**Body composition:** rocky  \n**Atmosphere:** just right   \n**Liquid:** water  \n**Endogenic features:** volcanoes, faults. Plate tectonics is unique to Earth.  \n**Exogenic features:** rivers, lakes, dunes, floodplains, deltas, glaciers. Glacial features on Earth are not permanent, most of the time there is no ice cap on Earth.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** 100+ impact craters, many buried or eroded due to erosion, or destroyed by plate tectonics (subduction), or impacted into water without permanent crater.  \n**Common features:** oceans, mountains, plains, rivers  \n**Rare features:** glaciers  \n**Life limiting parameter:** where it is too dry (no liquid water - deserts), too cold (no liquid water \u2013 Antarctica)  \n**Age:** mostly very young, some as old as 1 billion years.   \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/3f31972e-2735-4af8-93f1-b2361013fb30/olympus.jpg)\nSize comparison of the highest mountains on Earth and Olympus Mons on Mars\n", "fulldesc": "The teacher should have the map of Titan either printed in a size that is still readable and accessible physically for the students, or projected onto a canvas at full resolution. \n\nFrom this step you can choose one or several of the following subtopics designed to a teacher-instructed structured classroom activity with or without the handouts or you can follow the handout in itself. The instructions for the activities are also shown on the handout.\n\nRead Page 1 of the handout with students, asking them to underline any words they do not understand so you can explain them.\n\n###CARTOGRAPHY \n\nShow the map to the class and ask the students why the map representation of the body is circular (e.g., the planet is a spherical body). Now ask why there are two circle (hemisphere)-maps shown on the map. Explain that a sphere is represented by two circular projections, and those are the two sides of the one single sphere. We call one western (left), the other eastern (right) hemisphere. \n\n**Activity 1: **\n- Draw the Equator (a horizontal line in the middle of the two circles), \n- Mark the poles (in both hemispheres) and \n- Write the name of the body as a map title. \n\nCompare the cartographic representation with real photograph. (SEE HANDOUT FIGURE ONE) Ask about the differences between the two pictures. Cartographic generalization (simplification) has been used and extra emphasis placed on the important but not necessarily visually prominent features. For planets with opaque atmosphere, the surface is not visible on the photo. Map colors may be different from real colors. Which elements are not on the photo that are present on the map? Why are those elements needed? (NOTE: Alien Creatures are NOT REAL).\n\n###GEOLOGY\nAsk the class what geological information (about the landforms) they can see on the map. Name at least one such feature type (See Activity 2 on the handout for a list of them).\n\nIdentify/find endogenic landforms that were produced by magma from below the surface (volcanic landforms: volcanoes, lava flows, tectonic landforms: cracks, fractures). \nIdentify /find exogenic landforms that were produced by processes that operate on the surface in a planet with atmosphere (wind: dunes, deserts, water: weathering, rivers, oceans, lakes, sediments).\nIdentify /find cosmogenic landforms that were produced by impact processes (impact craters or impact basins made by asteroids or comets coming from outer space).\n\n**Activity 2** - Graphic map. Using the map, draw a generalized (simplified) sketch map, showing the outlines of only the largest and most important features (draw several types of features, e.g., cracks and craters). You can use colors and/or lines. \nTry to include the following featurs:\n- **Exogenic (liquids):**  \nGroups of Lakes at both poles (Kraken Mare, Ontario Lacus)  \nRivers (Fluctus)  \n- **Aeolian (wind produced)**  \nLong, subparallel dark dunes at the equator\n- **Other**  \nXanadu mountainous region  \n\n\n\n###EXPLORATION\n\nAsk students where would they land / build a settlement(s) for more exploration? Which region (or feature) is worth more exploration?  Why? What do you want to investigate? What instruments/tools/methods would you use for the investigation? What would you bring with you for this research?\n\n**Activity 3** - Your landing site. Where would you land? Which place you find the most exciting for exploration? Find YOUR landing site. Mark it with a symbol. Name your landing site (s). Write down the names next to the symbol.\n\n###TOPONYMY\nAsk students to read one name from the map aloud.  Ask what they understand from them, i.e. what the names tell them. The names are in Latin as the planets are not part of any country and Latin is considered a neutral international language. Ask students if they like this \u201cneutral\u201d (Latin) naming or name in English (or your language) would be better. You may explain the meaning of the names on the map. You can find the English equivalents in this site: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n\n**Activity 4** - Names. After the graphic part is finished, create the nomenclature: write the names of the features you have drawn next to the feature itself. Write three names (you can add more later) onto the map. You can use different colors or letters for each feature type (e.g, capital letters for continents, red color for the lava channel etc. -- be consistent).\n\n###ASTRONOMY, CLIMATOLOGY, METEOROLOGY\nAsk students if there is atmosphere on the planet and why they think this\n\nFind weather data (max/min surface temperature) on the map control board or on the handout. Do not confuse coordinate values (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 etc.) shown on the map with temperature values shown on the control board. \n\nAsk students if there is liquid water or other liquid material on the planet and how do they know that. Compare local temperature ranges (max-min) with freezing / boiling temperature of water. What is the chance of finding liquid water? \n\n**Activity 5** - Weather forecast for \"tomorrow\", based on the Weather information in the handout. Choose at least three places, and show weather data: display the min/max temperature in your unit (C or F) with LARGE numbers. Consider that on towards the poles it is colder. Next to the numbers, show the weather with a graphic symbol you design: clear (sunny), cloudy, rainy, foggy or any interesting, special weather phenomenon you learn from the handout. Find min/max temperature data on the map's control desk and additional information on the handout.\n\nAsk students what protective clothing they would need if they were to explore the surface away from their vehicles, using the values discussed previously. For example, they may need oxygen tanks, a suit that maintains room temperature, pressure etc.\n\n**Activity 6** - Design a flag for Titan, and draw it on the map, based on the characteristics of the body (weather, color, geology etc).\n\nAsk students if the creatures, or plants or animals would survive on Titan, using the values given in the control panel (temperature, pressure \u2013 use the concept of liquid water = habitability: if liquid water can exits, life may (or may not) exist). Explain that no present life forms or traces of past life have ever been discovered on any other planet or moon in the Solar System or outside it on exoplanets, however, there are millions of planets never explored by us. What kind of creatures could exist there? What protection / skills would they need for survival? What would they look like? (e.g., thick fur, or underground animals etc.). What would they eat? How would they communicate with each other? (For example, without air, no sound exist).  \n\n###LEGEND\n**Activity 7** \u2013 Draw a legend where YOUR symbols are explained on the map. You may group them by process (e.g., exogenic (atmospheric, aeolian), endogenic (volcanic, tectonic) and impact processes). Write down the title \u201cLEGEND\u201d and explain your symbols and indicate which feature it corresponds to.\n\n**Homework:** Ask students to compose or draw stories using the map\u2019s landscapes as background for the story, and their creatures as the characters of the story. A possible storyline: how the surface became like what it is now? (as told with a story, not scientifically).  You can also Illustrate the story. \n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "The language of the maps and accompanying texts about various bodies is translated to 11 languages so if a teacher speaks English, he or she can use materials of this activity in the following languages:\nPresently the Pluto map is only offered in English.\n \nEnglish https://childrensmaps.wordpress.com/ \nFrench, http://cartespourenfants.wordpress.com/ \nGerman, http://kartenfuerkinder.wordpress.com/ \nHungarian,  http://gyerekterkep.wordpress.com/ \nItalian, http://mappeperbambini.wordpress.com/ \nPolish, https://mapydladzieci.wordpress.com/ \nPortuguese, http://mapasparacriancas.wordpress.com/ \nRomani (Gipsy) http://mapileshavorenge.wordpress.com/ \nRomanian, http://hartipentrucopii.wordpress.com/ \nRussian, http://kartydlyadetey.wordpress.com/ \nSpanish, http://mapasparaninos.wordpress.com/ \n\n", "conclusion": "Using planetary maps, students will be able to read cartographic information and compare the environmental conditions of Titan to those Earth.

Water may exist underground. \n**Weather:** Diurnal temperature range (changes in temperature due to day and night) and forms of precipitation.  \n**Endogenic features:** Features produced by forces in the interior of the planet. **Volcanism** requires molten interior. Heat is provided from planetary formation (impact / accretion heat) or the irreversible decay of radioactive elements. Small bodies cool quicker than large bodies, so volcanism is found only on larger planets. An exception is if the interior is continuously heated. This happens inside moons on elliptic orbits where tidal forces produce interior heat (e.g. Io).  **Tectonic** features are caused by stresses in the brittle crust.  Tectonic forces produce fractures during earthquakes. This requires movements within the planet, also driven by internal heat. Volcanoes grow upward by adding more lava but may collapse and produce crater-like caldera. \n**Exogenic features:** Features produced by processes on the surface or atmosphere. Includes aeolian (wind), fluvial (river), lacustrine (lake), oceanic features and their deposits.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** Features produced by impacting bodies (smaller craters and larger impact basins). Younger craters have radial rays (produced by ejected materials)  \n**Common features:** The most common features are craters. Most craters were formed soon after the Solar System formed and still had many small bodies in space. Craters are rare on surfaces that have been resurfaced recently, because resurfacing removes or buries craters. Resurfacing processes include volcanic plains, fluvial erosion and sedimentation, and subduction by plate tectonics.  \n**Rare/Special Features:** Features not found in many other places, they may be caused by very specific atmospheric/climate conditions or a remnant of an unusual event in the bodies past.  \n**Life limiting parameter:** Life should be able to grow and reproduce. Life may be limited by below freezing or above boiling temperatures, lack of atmosphere, lack of water or lack of magnetosphere (magnetospheres protect bodies from dangerous radiation in solar winds).  \n**Nomenclature (Naming):** Placenames can be proposed by the scientists who study a region or feature and it is approved by the working group of the International Astronomical Union\u2019s specialized to planetary placenames. Each feature type and each body has a particular theme (for example, gods of fire for Io) and the generic terms (like Mountain) are in Latin language to ensure language-neutrality. This also follows the geographic traditions of the 1600s when the first maps of the Moons were created in Europe with Latin names.  \n**Age:** Age of the surface. Many craters on the surface indicates an old surface age (4 billion years old), fewer craters indicates a younger surface age (0-3 billion years old). In the early solar system (c. 4 billion years ago) there were many small objects that could impact on the bodies causing craters. Later on, there were far fewer objects as they had impacted onto the planets or been moved away by their gravitational fields.  \n\n**Shapes of geologic features:**  \n**Circular:** usually an impact crater, occasionally a volcanic caldera  \n**Linear (straight):** negative elevation = tectonic fracture, positive elevation = dune, ridge or mountain  \n**Sinuous:** river or lava channel  \n**Lobate:** water rich impact crater, ejecta (debris thrown out by an impact or volcano), glacier, landslide  \n**Radial:** impact crater ray  \n**Concentric:** impact crater ring  \n\n\nEarth for comparison:\n(MAP: use http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html for Earth map or Google map).\n\n**Body type:** planet  \n**Body composition:** rocky  \n**Atmosphere:** just right   \n**Liquid:** water  \n**Endogenic features:** volcanoes, faults. Plate tectonics is unique to Earth.  \n**Exogenic features:** rivers, lakes, dunes, floodplains, deltas, glaciers. Glacial features on Earth are not permanent, most of the time there is no ice cap on Earth.  \n**Cosmogenic features:** 100+ impact craters, many buried or eroded due to erosion, or destroyed by plate tectonics (subduction), or impacted into water without permanent crater.  \n**Common features:** oceans, mountains, plains, rivers  \n**Rare features:** glaciers  \n**Life limiting parameter:** where it is too dry (no liquid water - deserts), too cold (no liquid water \u2013 Antarctica)  \n**Age:** mostly very young, some as old as 1 billion years.   \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a1052493-715f-4f57-b87f-0c19eeed6889/olympus.jpg)\nSize comparison of the highest mountains on Earth and Olympus Mons on Mars\n", "fulldesc": "The teacher should have the map of Pluto and Charon either printed in a size that is still readable and accessible physically for the students, or projected onto a canvas at full resolution. \n\nFrom this step you can choose one or several of the following subtopics designed to a teacher-instructed structured classroom activity with or without the handouts or you can follow the handout in itself. The instructions for the activities are also shown on the handout.\n\nRead Page 1 of the handout with students, asking them to underline any words they do not understand so you can explain them.\n\n###CARTOGRAPHY \nShow the map to the class and ask the students why the map representation of the body is circular (e.g., the planet is a spherical body). Explain that the system has only ever been visited by a probe (New Horizons) once, and it could only see one side of each body, and the Southern Hemispheres were in darkness as well.\n\n**Activity 1: **  \n- Draw the Equator (a horizontal line in the middle of the two circles),   \n- Mark the poles    \n- Write the name of the body as a map title.   \n\n\nCompare the cartographic representation with real photograph. (SEE HANDOUT FIGURE ONE) Ask about the differences between the two pictures. Cartographic generalization (simplification) has been used and extra emphasis placed on the important but not necessarily visually prominent features. For planets with opaque atmosphere, the surface is not visible on the photo. Map colors may be different from real colors. Which elements are not on the photo that are present on the map? Why are those elements needed? (NOTE: Alien Creatures are NOT REAL).\n\n###GEOLOGY\nAsk the class what geological information (about the landforms) they can see on the map. Name at least one such feature type (See Activity 2 on the handout for a list of them).\n\nIdentify/find endogenic landforms that were produced by magma from below the surface (volcanic landforms: volcanoes, lava flows, tectonic landforms: cracks, fractures). \nIdentify /find exogenic landforms that were produced by processes that operate on the surface in a planet with atmosphere (wind: dunes, deserts, water: weathering, rivers, oceans, lakes, sediments).\nIdentify /find cosmogenic landforms that were produced by impact processes (impact craters or impact basins made by asteroids or comets coming from outer space).\n\n**Activity 2** - Graphic map. Using the map, draw a generalized (simplified) sketch map, showing the outlines of only the largest and most important features (draw several types of features, e.g., cracks and craters). You can use colors and/or lines. \nTry to include the following featurs:\n\n**Pluto (left circle)**  \n- Glacial: \"Heart\" shaped frozen nitrogen ice plains (Sputnik Planitia) with cellular terrain and ice mountain peaks  \n- Southern dark-red coated regions  \n- impact craters  \n- tectonic cracks  \n\n**Charon (right circle)**  \n- Tectonic \u2013 Equatorial deep chasms  \n- Cosmogenic \u2013 North Polar red spot (red material coming from Pluto)  \n- Impact: Few rayed craters, non rayed craters everywhere  \n \n\n\n###EXPLORATION\n\nAsk students where would they land / build a settlement(s) for more exploration? Which region (or feature) is worth more exploration?  Why? What do you want to investigate? What instruments/tools/methods would you use for the investigation? What would you bring with you for this research?\n\n**Activity 3** - Your landing site. Where would you land? Which place you find the most exciting for exploration? Find YOUR landing site. Mark it with a symbol. Name your landing site (s). Write down the names next to the symbol.\n\n###TOPONYMY\nAsk students to read one name from the map aloud.  Ask what they understand from them, i.e. what the names tell them. The names are in Latin as the planets are not part of any country and Latin is considered a neutral international language. Ask students if they like this \u201cneutral\u201d (Latin) naming or name in English (or your language) would be better. You may explain the meaning of the names on the map. You can find the English equivalents in this site: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n\n**Activity 4** - Names. After the graphic part is finished, create the nomenclature: write the names of the features you have drawn next to the feature itself. Write three names (you can add more later) onto the map. You can use different colors or letters for each feature type (e.g, capital letters for continents, red color for the lava channel etc. -- be consistent).\n\n###ASTRONOMY, CLIMATOLOGY, METEOROLOGY\nAsk students if there is atmosphere on the planet and why they think this\n\nFind weather data (max/min surface temperature) on the map control board or on the handout. Do not confuse coordinate values (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 etc.) shown on the map with temperature values shown on the control board. \n\nAsk students if there is liquid water or other liquid material on the planet and how do they know that. Compare local temperature ranges (max-min) with freezing / boiling temperature of water. What is the chance of finding liquid water? \n\n**Activity 5** - Weather forecast for \"tomorrow\", based on the Weather information in the handout. Choose at least three places, and show weather data: display the min/max temperature in your unit (C or F) with LARGE numbers. Consider that on towards the poles it is colder. Next to the numbers, show the weather with a graphic symbol you design: clear (sunny), cloudy, rainy, foggy or any interesting, special weather phenomenon you learn from the handout. Find min/max temperature data on the map's control desk and additional information on the handout.\n\nAsk students what protective clothing they would need if they were to explore the surface away from their vehicles, using the values discussed previously. For example, they may need oxygen tanks, a suit that maintains room temperature, pressure etc.\n\n**Activity 6 - Design a flag** (either for Pluto, Charon, or for both as one), and draw it on the map, based on the characteristics of the body (weather, color, geology etc).\n\nAsk students if the creatures, or plants or animals would survive on Pluto and Charon, using the values given in the control panel (temperature, pressure \u2013 use the concept of liquid water = habitability: if liquid water can exits, life may (or may not) exist). Explain that no present life forms or traces of past life have ever been discovered on any other planet or moon in the Solar System or outside it on exoplanets, however, there are millions of planets never explored by us. What kind of creatures could exist there? What protection / skills would they need for survival? What would they look like? (e.g., thick fur, or underground animals etc.). What would they eat? How would they communicate with each other? (For example, without air, no sound exist).  \n\n###LEGEND\nActivity 7 \u2013 Draw a legend where YOUR symbols are explained on the map. You may group them by process (e.g., exogenic (atmospheric, aeolian), endogenic (volcanic, tectonic) and impact processes). Write down the title \u201cLEGEND\u201d and explain your symbols and indicate which feature it corresponds to.\n\n**Homework:** Ask students to compose or draw stories using the map\u2019s landscapes as background for the story, and their creatures as the characters of the story. A possible storyline: how the surface became like what it is now? (as told with a story, not scientifically).  You can also Illustrate the story. \n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "Using planetary maps, students will be able to read cartographic information and compare the environmental conditions of Pluto/Charon to those Earth.

An asteroid is called a meteorite if it hits the Earth. If it completely evaporates in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere before crashing on the surface, it\u2019s called a meteor. People usually refer to meteors as \u2018shooting stars\u2019. Most meteorites are composed of silicates or a mixture of iron and nickel. In the past, some huge meteorites have struck Earth. Sixty-five million years ago, almost 90% of animal species were eradicated (including dinosaurs) when a meteorite hit Yucatan, Mexico. Luckily, this happens very rarely! We owe this to Jupiter, which attracts many asteroids with its gravitational pull.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/Asteroid%20Ida.jpg) \n**Asteroid Ida**\n\n**How are asteroids formed?**\n\nDust particles in the early Solar System collided, forming larger clumps, known as planetesimals. These could grow by attracting more dust with their gravitational fields; some grew large enough to form the planets. Others remained, becoming the asteroids. Some of these asteroids collided with each other (and the early planets), fragmenting into smaller asteroids. Some of the collisions were slow enough that the asteroids merged, producing oddly shaped asteroids.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/ESO%20antiope%20doublet.jpg)\n \n**Where are asteroids located?**\n\nMany asteroids form large rings or belts around the Sun. There are two asteroid belts in our Solar System: the main belt (or simply called the asteroid belt) between Mars and Jupiter, with thousands of asteroids (see picture below), and the Kuiper belt, named after its discoverer, a disk-shaped region that extends outside of Neptune\u2019s orbit and contains countless asteroids and many dwarf planets, of which Pluto is the most famous.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/UNAWE%20asteroid%20belt.jpg)\n\nMost asteroids are found in the asteroid belt; however, there are asteroids that are not in that orbit, and they are called Near Earth Objects (NEO). Sometimes these NEOs can reach our planet Earth.\n \n**Why are asteroids important to study?**\n\nAsteroids are part of a group known as minor bodies. Asteroids, comets and meteoroids can provide valuable information about the evolution of our Solar System\nAdditionally, there are small bodies called meteoroids, remnants of the formation of the Solar System. These meteoroids can be as small as a grain of rice. Meteoroids constantly meet Earth, producing what we see on Earth as \u2018shooting stars\u2019.\n\n**Is it true that an asteroid can hit Earth?** \n\nAn asteroid 10 kilometres in diameter hit the Earth 65 million years ago. This asteroid impact on the Earth is assumed to be one of the reasons why the dinosaurs became extinct.\n\n**Comets** \n\nYou can also tell the students about comets. Comets are like dirty snowballs or icy lumps of mud. They consist of a mixture of ice (from water as well as from frozen gases) and dust. Like asteroids, comets revolve around the Sun. However, their orbits are strongly elongated compared to planets. That is, they occasionally get very close to the Sun, and at times they get very far away. When they cross a planet\u2019s orbit, they could collide with it. This happened, for example, in 1994, when the comet Shoemaker-Levy collided with planet Jupiter and broke into pieces. When comets come close to the Sun in their orbit, the ice in their core melts and evaporates. This results in a beautiful tail, which can be clearly seen in the night sky if the comet passes close enough to the Earth.\nIn 2061, Halley\u2019s Comet will once again come close to the Earth. It orbits our Sun once every 76 years. Remember to mark its arrival on your calendar!\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/halley%20comet.jpg)\n**Halleys Comet**\n", "fulldesc": "###Step 1\nShow the students a photo of an asteroid.

Let them divide it into smaller pieces and place these fragments on a table. Keep an eye on younger students while they handle the clay to ensure that they do not ingest it.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/UNAWE%20clay.jpg) \n\n###Step 3\n\nTake the larger piece of clay and start attaching the smaller pieces slowly one by one.

Around every young star is a disc of little pieces of dust, out of which planets and asteroids form.\n\nIn this activity, the students have learned about asteroids through discussion and by moulding their own asteroids using clay.

Several people have been struck by small meteorites, such as http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130220-russia-meteorite-ann-hodges-science-space-hit  however, no one is known to have died as a direct result. \nIn 1992, the Peekskill Meteor was seen travelling over much of the east coast of America, before landing on a car, damaging its bodywork\nhttp://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061119.html .\n  \nVery rarely, a massive meteorite will hit Earth with enough speed to form an impact crater. These craters can tell us a lot about the size and speed of the meteor, and any effects it may have had on the planet. For example, the Tunguska event occurred in Russia in 1908, flattening 2000 square kilometres of forest \u2013 the most likely cause of the massive explosion was a meteorite. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/72ae6987-b988-4a3b-ae16-95106c744749/Tunguska.png)\n**One of the few images of the Tunguska Event**\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this was a relatively small impact. Craters can be dated back and linked to the timeline of events in the planet\u2019s history, to show that meteorites may have been responsible for many previously unexplained timeline changes.\n\nThe extinction of the dinosaurs has been attributed to a huge meteorite strike that caused the Chicxulub crater under the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Deposits in the crater have been aged to the same time as the last dinosaur fossils. The huge impact that resulted in the crater, which is 180 km in diameter and 20 km deep, would have triggered global tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The dust and gas released may have also have blacked out the Sun, plunging the world into a mini ice age.\n\nAs Earth has an active atmosphere with weather, these craters can easily become lost because of weathering. Geological activity can also hide them, for example if the surface is re-covered with lava. Solar System bodies without atmospheres or geological activity have many more visible craters than Earth. Smaller objects do not burn up or slow down on bodies without atmospheres; hence, they may cause many more small impact craters than on Earth.\n\n ![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/72ae6987-b988-4a3b-ae16-95106c744749/moon%20crater.jpg)\n**The cratered face of the moon**\n  \nMany craters can be seen on this image of the far side of the moon. (Note: there are more craters visible on the far side than the visible side of the moon. This is thought to be because of increased volcanic activity on the Earth side covering up any large craters with fresh lava.)\n\nThe term \u2018meteorite\u2019 is given to anything that falls from space and makes it down to Earth. Asteroids and comets can both fall as meteors, causing craters on Earth if they land. Asteroids are made of rock and metal; most are found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are made of rock fragments held together by ice. They have very elliptical (oval shaped) orbits, coming from outside Neptune towards the Sun and then going back again.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/72ae6987-b988-4a3b-ae16-95106c744749/Chicxulub-animation.gif)\n**Animation of the formation of the Chicxulub crater ** (Credit \u2013 University of Arizona, Space Imagery Center).\n\nCraters are formed by the impacting body imparting its energy to the Earth, causing massive shockwaves. Their formation can be separated into three stages\n-\tThe Compression Stage \u2013 This is the initial transfer of energy between the meteorite and the Earth. The front of the meteor hits the Earth, compressing the ground below it, and the back moves towards the front, compressing the entire body at an immense pressure.\n-\tThe Excavation Stage \u2013 The energy vapourises (melts then boils) the meteorite and parts of the ground below it, sending rock vapour miles into the atmosphere. Molten and solid rock from around the impact site can be thrown hundreds of miles by the shock wave. Material thrown out is called Ejecta. A lot of material builds up around the crater, forming the classic ring.\n-\tThe Final Modification Stage \u2013 some Ejecta falls into the crater, partially filling it.\n\nThe pressure of the shockwave can change the structure of the rocks around the impact crater. The intense heat can melt rock, sand, and soil nearby, which can form \u2018impact glass\u2019, a dark coloured glass as it cools rapidly.\n\nLarger impacts can form much more complex craters, such as the Chicxulub crater (shown in the above animation). The shockwaves can rebound, causing uplifts within the crater and other complex patterns. Over time, weathering will change the shape of the crater further.\n", "fulldesc": "###Introduction\nShow the class the photo of the craters on the moon, and ask them what they could be and what could have caused them. \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/72ae6987-b988-4a3b-ae16-95106c744749/moon%20crater.jpg)\n\nDiscuss meteors/meteorites with the class, and ask them whether they have ever seen a shooting star. Tell them about their origins as comets and asteroids, and discuss with them the impact they can have on Earth.\nShow the class the images of the Peekskill meteor and the damage it caused to the car and the injury sustained by Ann Hodges in 1954. Explain that these were only small meteorites, and that larger ones can lead to greater damage. Show them the photo of the Tunguska event, and explain how much damage a relatively small strike caused. \nDiscuss the Chicxulub crater and the extinction of the dinosaurs. \n\nShow them the video of Meteor Crater in Arizona:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odGrgsLkfUQ\n\nIf the class can understand the concepts, talk them through the three stages of crater formation: Compression, Excavation and the Final stage. Otherwise, explain that the crater is caused by the impact pushing material out from underneath the meteorite.\n\nAsk the students what factors they think might affect the size of the crater formed, and what effect they might have.\n\n###Experiment 1 \u2013 Mass\n\nIn the first experiment, the students will investigate how the mass of a meteor affects the size of its crater. They should: \n\n1) Fill the container with sand to a depth of approximately 10 cm  \n2) Smooth the surface of the sand  \n3) Clamp the meter-long ruler vertically using the stand next to the container or tape it vertically to the side of the container  \n4) Measure the mass of each of the rocks on the scale accurately  \n5) Drop the first rock from a height of 30 cm  \n6) Carefully remove the rock from the sand without damaging the impact crater  \n7) Measure the diameter of the crater and write it down  \n8) Smooth the sand back down again  \n9) Repeat steps 5-8 with the other two rocks  \n8) Plot a graph comparing the mass of the rock (X-axis) with the crater size (Y-axis)  \n\nDepending on the class, some of the above steps (filling containers etc) may be done by the teacher prior to the lesson. Take repeat measurements and average the data or create error bars on the graph if appropriate for the class. If the class is not comfortable data graphs, it would be possible to simply relate the idea that bigger rocks make bigger craters.\n\n\n###Experiment 2 \u2013 Drop Height\n\nStudents will investigate how the drop height affects the size of the impact crater. Emphasise the idea that the drop height is related to impact speed, so a greater drop height would be the equivalent of a more fast-moving meteorite. They should:\n\n1) Smooth the sand down  \n2) Drop the smallest (20g) rock from a height of 10 cm  \n3) Carefully remove it and measure the crater  \n4) Repeat the above steps, increasing the drop height (increasing in 10 cm increments up to 1 m is suggested, but this can be changed)  \n5) Plot a graph comparing drop height (X-axis) with crater size (Y-axis)  \n\nDepending on the class, take repeat measurements and/or create error bars. If the class is familiar with the equations of motion for constant acceleration (SUVAT equations), it would be possible to get them to plot impact speed against crater size instead. \n\n\n###Using the results\n\nDrop a rock of approximately 80g from the same height as the students were dropping their rocks in experiment 1, and measure the crater. The students have to use their graphs to try and work out the mass of this rock \u2013 this can be converted into a competition.\n\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "Students will learn how a crater is made from an impacting asteroid hitting the Earth and the effects this can have.\nThey will learn about the effects of recent meteorite strikes and the impacts relatively small meteorites can have.\nThey will learn how the crater size depends on the impactor mass and the impact speed.\n", "alert_message": "", "short_desc_material": "", "further_reading": "0", "reference": "", "big_idea": "", "spaceawe_authorship": ""}}, {"model": "activities.activitytranslation", "pk": 66, "fields": {"language_code": "it", "master": 18, "slug": "lammasso-di-galassie-della-chioma", "title": "L'ammasso di galassie della Chioma", "teaser": "Impara le basi della classificazione delle galassie usando le vere immagini del Telescopio Spaziale Hubble", "theme": "galassie", "keywords": "galassie, ammasso della chioma, coma", "acknowledgement": "Kyle Fricke, Mary Kay Hemenway.

Edwin Hubble fu il primo a elaborare tale schema. Hubble inizialmente riteneva che la sua classificazione, nota anche come \u201cforchetta di Hubble\u201d, rappresentasse l\u2019evoluzione stessa delle galassie. Nonostante tale ipotesi si rivel\u00f2 errata, ancora oggi gli astronomi continuano a utilizzare tale classificazione per descrivere le caratteristiche galassie.\n\n####I principali tipi di galassie\nEllittiche (E), Lenticolari (S0), Lenticolari Barrate (SB0), Spirali (S), Spirali Barrate (SB) e Irregolari (IR). La descrizione dettagliata delle varie classi sar\u00e0 mostrata nelle successive sezioni dell\u2019attivit\u00e0\n\n####Un ulteriore tipo di galassie\nGalassie interagenti: si tratta di due o pi\u00f9 galassie cos\u00ec vicine tra loro da interagire l\u2019una con l\u2019altra, portando a un modificarsi della loro forma.\n\n####Provenienza dei dati utilizzati in quest\u2019attivit\u00e0. \nIn quest\u2019attivit\u00e0 vengono utilizzate immagini dell\u2019ammasso di galassie della Chioma ottenute dal Telescopio Spaziale Hubble. Si tratta di osservazioni eseguite nel 2006, utilizzando lo strumento Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS), montato a bordo del Telescopio Spaziale Hubble.\n\n####Ambiente galattico\nLe galassie popolano l\u2019intero Universo e si trovano in una grande variet\u00e0 di ambienti differenti. Possono presentarsi in ammassi, gruppi oppure essere isolate.\n\n####Gruppi\nI gruppi sono insiemi costituiti da una manciata di galassie. Il Gruppo Locale, ad esempio, \u00e8 il gruppo di galassie che contiene la Nostra Galassia, la Via Lattea, oltre alle galassie a noi pi\u00f9 vicine: le Nubi di Magellano, la Galassia di Andromeda e a un\u2019altra decina di galassie.\n\n####Il campo\nAltre volte, le galassie possono essere isolate e molto lontane le une dalle altre. Queste sono chiamate galassie di campo.\n\n####Ammassi\nGli ammassi di galassie sono tra le strutture pi\u00f9 grandi presenti nell\u2019Universo, sono costituiti da centinaia o migliaia di galassie gravitazionalmente legate tra loro. Tutte le galassie che compongono l\u2019ammasso sono ravvicinate le une alle altre, come nell\u2019ammasso della Chioma. \nAmmassi, gruppi e alcune galassie isolate potrebbero far parte di strutture ancora pi\u00f9 grandi dette superammassi. A pi\u00f9 grande scala nell\u2019universo visibile i superammassi sono raccolti in filamenti e circondati dal vuoto. Ci si riferisce spesso a queste strutture come \u201cragnatela cosmica\u201d (cosmic web).\n", "fulldesc": "Per prima cosa gli studenti analizzeranno 40 immagini di varie galassie, in modo da familiarizzare con le differenti tipologie e morfologie di oggetti.

Di seguito alcuni suggerimenti per la discussione:\n\n- Quali sono i punti in comune tra le varie classificazioni?\n- E le differenze pi\u00f9 significative?\n- Perch\u00e9 gli studenti hanno scelto un metodo di classificazione piuttosto che un altro?\n- Quali potrebbero essere altri metodi di classificazione, per esempio se fossero stati forniti dati diversi per le medesime galassie?\n- Perch\u00e9 \u00e8 importante (oppure no) classificare i diversi oggetti?\n- Potrebbe tale schema essere modificato con il tempo?\n\nTali punti possono essere rivisti anche in seguito durante l\u2019attivit\u00e0.\n\nNota: probabilmente alcuni studenti potrebbero classificare le varie galassie seguendo un metodo basato sulla forma - se cos\u00ec non fosse, a seguito della discussione avvenuta precedente incoraggiare gli studenti nella realizzazione di altri schemi di classificazioni basati questa volta sulla forma.\n\nChiedere agli studenti di fare osservazioni e fare domande partendo dall\u2019analisi delle immagini osservate, discutendone in gruppo e annotando i risultati. L\u2019obiettivo \u00e8 suscitare nei ragazzi la domanda: \u201cperch\u00e9 le galassie hanno forme differenti?\u201d. Successivamente, sollecitare gli studenti nella discussione e scrittura delle conclusioni relative al perch\u00e9 le galassie dovrebbero avere forme differenti. Ad esempio:\n\n- Le galassie quando si formano nascono gi\u00e0 con forme differenti, oppure tali differenze sono il risultato di una loro evoluzione? \n- Quale esito evolutivo potrebbero aver avuto galassie diverse? (in particolar modo cosa potrebbe aver influenzato la loro forma)? (incoraggiare gli studenti a ragionare sul fatto che le galassie possono interagire tra loro).\n- I cambiamenti nella forma delle galassie potrebbero essere dovuti a processi interni alla galassia o a effetti esterni? (ad esempio un determinato fenomeno che si riscontra in tutte le galassie e che ne modifica la forma nel tempo, oppure qualche effetto d\u2019interazione con altre galassie).\n- Potrebbe la forma essere influenzata dalle dimensioni della galassia all\u2019atto della sua formazione?\n- Le diverse forme osservate sono transienti o sono stabili nel tempo?\n\nMentre gli studenti riflettono su tali considerazioni, stimolarli nella discussione e nella ricerca di informazioni per dare risposta a queste domande. (Qualche studente potrebbe ipotizzare che l\u2019interazione tra le varie galassie sia un fenomeno molto importante, e che osservare regioni ricche di galassie potrebbe aumentare le probabilit\u00e0 di osservare interazioni, il che sarebbe un ottimo modo per studiare tale fenomeno. A prescindere da ci\u00f2, tale discussione preliminare si rilever\u00e0 molto utile nella prosecuzione dell\u2019attivit\u00e0).\n\n###Step 3\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d37a0e75-683c-45c0-b169-00347371cf83/1410_galaxies_table.jpg)\n\nSpiegazioni per gli studenti: gli astronomi hanno sviluppato l\u2019attuale classificazione delle galassie basandosi sulla loro forma (la loro morfologia). Le definizioni per ogni tipologia di galassie sono riportate di seguito. Seguendo tali definizioni, suddividere le 12 immagini di galassie precedenti nei diversi gruppi completando la tabella seguente.\n\n- **Ellittiche (E)**: galassie con una forma sferica o ellittica (come un pallone da rugby); esse non presentano alcun tipo di disco e nemmeno bracci a spirale.\n- **Lenticolari (S0)**: galassie a disco ma prive di bracci a spirale; non semplici da distinguere rispetto alle galassie ellittiche.\n- **Lenticolari barrate (SB0)**: come le galassie lenticolari, ma con un nucleo (centro galattico) che presenta una forma allungata (barra).\n- **Spirali (S)**: galassie caratterizzate da un disco con la presenza di chiare ed evidenti strutture a spirale che si dipanano dal centro, presentano anche una zona centrale molto luminosa.\n- **Spirali barrate (SB)**: una speciale classe di galassie a spirale caratterizzate da un nucleo allungato (barra) con i bracci che partono dagli estremi di tale barra.\n- **Irregolari (IR)**: particolari galassie che non rientrano in nessuna delle precedenti categorie.\n\nMorfologia | Numero dell\u2019immagine corrispondente (3 per ogni categoria)\n:---: | ---\n**E/S0/SB0** |\n**S** |\n**SB** |\n**IR** | \n\nNota: le galassie pi\u00f9 piccole son spesso chiamate \u201cgalassie nane\u201d (le galassie numero 5 e 7 sono galassie nane). Tali galassie contengono pochi miliardi di stelle, un numero basso se confrontato con i 200 miliardi di stelle che compongono la Via Lattea. Le galassie ellittiche pi\u00f9 grandi contengono svariati trilioni di galassie.\n\nDiscussione: mettere in relazione questo schema di classificazione con quello proposto dagli studenti nei punti precedenti.\n\n###Step 4:\nSpiegazioni per gli studenti: utilizzare l\u2019immagine seguente e le relative linee guida come supporto nell\u2019identificazione e relativo computo delle galassie dell\u2019ammasso.\n\nSpiegazioni per gli studenti: utilizzare l\u2019immagine seguente e le relative linee guida come supporto nell\u2019identificazione e relativo computo delle galassie dell\u2019ammasso.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/d37a0e75-683c-45c0-b169-00347371cf83/1410_coma_galaxy_cluster.jpg)\n \n####Linee guida:\n- **I) ellittiche o lenticolari**: potrebbe essere difficile distinguerle. \u00c8 importante distinguere tra E o S0/SB0\n- **II) spirali o spirali barrate**: potrebbe essere difficile distinguerle. \u00c8 importante distinguere tra S o SB\n- **III) Irregolari**\n- **IV) Incerte**: Galassie viste di taglio potrebbero essere S0, SB0, S SB o IR.

Le galassie si trovano in ambienti molto diversi tra loro. Negli ammassi troviamo una grande quantit\u00e0 di galassie, racchiuse le une vicino alle altre, proprio come nell\u2019ammasso di galassie della Chioma.  Altre volte le galassie sono raggruppate in formazioni costituite da un minor numero di oggetti, in questo caso parliamo di \u201cgruppi\u201d, come il Gruppo locale che contiene la Via Lattea e poche altre galassie. Altre volte invece sono isolate, lontane tra loro disperse nel campo.

E invece per quanto riguarda le galassie ellittiche?). _ Gli studenti dovrebbero notare che le galassie a spirale sono pi\u00f9 abbondanti nel campo mentre le galassie ellittiche sono pi\u00f9 comuni all\u2019interno degli ammassi. _\n\nDomande supplementari: \u00e8 un fenomeno usuale o denota una certa particolarit\u00e0? L\u2019obiettivo di questa fase \u00e8 appunto quello di suscitare negli studenti la domanda: \u201cperch\u00e9 le galassie a spirale (o ellittiche) dipendono dall\u2019ambiente in cui si trovano?\u201d\n\nInvitare gli studenti a ragionare e raccogliere spunti sul perch\u00e9 le varie tipologie di galassie sembrano essere influenzate da dalla propria posizione. come potrebbe essere identificato tale fenomeno: quali supposizioni si potrebbero fare a riguardo? Quali osservazioni o informazioni aggiuntive potrebbero essere necessarie? Come si potrebbe quantificare questo andamento usando i dati a disposizione?\n\n###Step 8\n\nLo step seguente mostra agli studenti come analizzare questo tipo di andamento, per prima cosa quantificando le galassie e successivamente ottenendo informazioni supplementari provenienti dalla letteratura in merito all\u2019evoluzione delle galassie. \u00c8 possibile fornire i dati agli studenti seguendo lo schema proposto di seguito. --- incoraggiare la discussione e la condivisione delle ipotesi di risposta ai relativi quesiti, partendo dalla quantificazione dell\u2019andamento, per poi determinare una procedura per attuare i calcoli presentati di seguito.\n\nUtilizzando un calcolatore, trovare le percentuali di ciascun tipo di galassia nell\u2019ammasso e nel campo (ignorare le galassie IR e INT). Utilizzare i numeri raccolti nelle tabelle precedenti per calcolare le percentuali e completare i seguenti incisi:\n\n_ Nell\u2019ammasso: _\n\n% di ellittiche (e/h) = ____%\n\n% di lenticolari (f/h) = ____%\n\n% di spirali (g/h) = ___%\n\n_ Nel campo: _\n\n% di ellittiche (i/m) = ____%\n\n% di lenticolari (j/m) = ____%\n\n% di spirali (k/m) = ___%\n\nDomanda: in quale caso si trova una pi\u00f9 alta percentuale di galassie a spirale \u2013 nell\u2019ammasso o nel campo?\n\nRisposta:________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSpiegazione per gli studenti: le percentuali trovate forniscono informazioni sulla diffusione delle tipologie di galassie. Indicano quali siano le pi\u00f9 comuni all\u2019interno dell\u2019ammasso della Chioma e quali sono le pi\u00f9 numerose nel campo. Gli astronomi hanno svolto la medesima ricerca osservando centinaia e migliaia di galassie nell\u2019universo vicino, e hanno scoperto quanto segue:\n\n- all\u2019interno di ammassi densi: 40% di galassie ellittiche, 50% di lenticolari e 10% di spirali\n- nel campo: 10% di galassie ellittiche, 10% di lenticolari e 80% di spirali\n\nQuando si trovano galassie molto vicine le une alle altre sono presenti molte pi\u00f9 galassie ellittiche e lenticolari, mentre quando si osserva il campo dove le galassie sono pi\u00f9 distanziate tra loro, dominano le galassie a spirali. Gli astronomi chiamano questa diversa distribuzione come \u201ceffetto morfologia-densit\u00e0\u201d. Ci\u00f2 significa che in ambienti costituiti da molte galassie vicine le une alle altre, come gli ammassi, troviamo una distribuzione diversa rispetto a quella che troviamo in regioni in cui le galassie sono pi\u00f9 distanziate come nel campo.\n\n###Step 9 \n\nA questo punto gli studenti dovrebbero essere in gradi di rispondere alla domanda: \u201cPerch\u00e9 si osserva un maggior numero di galassie ellittiche e lenticolari negli ammassi mentre nel campo troviamo un maggior numero di galassie a spirale? (Questa domanda pu\u00f2 essere anche espressa come segue: perch\u00e9 si osserva un effetto di morfonologia-densit\u00e0?). \n\nGli studenti dovrebbero ipotizzare che le interazioni che possono avvenire tra le galassie, giochino un ruolo importante e che all\u2019interno di un ambiente molto denso di galassie come il centro di un ammasso, il numero di interazioni risulta essere molto alto.\n\nDi seguito sono riportate informazioni che potrebbero essere utilizzate per rispondere a questa domanda. \u00c8 possibile fornire agli studenti il seguente testo da leggere, chiedere loro di commentarlo, discutere insieme su quanto appreso e annotare le varie conclusioni in merito a tale effetto. Oppure si pu\u00f2 continuare a lavorare con gli studenti raccogliendo le varie idee sulla questione e commentando insieme le possibili spiegazioni che emergono. In seguito gli studenti svolgeranno ricerche su testi o su internet, da soli o in gruppo, e in seguito condivideranno con il resto della classe i risultati raggiunti.\n\nSpiegazione:\n\nMolte galassie contengono quello che gli astronomi chiamano \u201cgas\u201d, costituito principalmente da idrogeno e alle volte mischiato con polveri e gas di altri elementi. Le nubi di gas, le quali hanno una certa massa, possono collassare sotto l\u2019azione della propria gravit\u00e0, e ci\u00f2 porta alla formazione di nuove stelle. Gli astronomi hanno osservato numerose galassie a spirale (S e SB) e hanno notato come queste galassie presentino una grande quantit\u00e0 di gas il che porta ad un\u2019intensa attiva e formazione stellare. Galassie ellittiche e lenticolari (E, S0 e SB0) sono, invece, povere di gas e la loro formazione stellare \u00e8 praticamente assente.\n\nGalassie che si trovano molto vicine le une alle altre, come succede in un ammasso, sono soggette a molteplici e violente interazioni che si sviluppano tra i vari membri dell\u2019ammasso. Quando una galassia a spirale, ricca di gas, interagisce con un\u2019altra galassia, questa tende a utilizzare una grande quantit\u00e0 del suo gas per avviare formazione stellare, perdendone poi un\u2019ulteriore quantit\u00e0. Tali interazioni spesso trasformano galassie ricche di gas in povere di gas. Molte galassie lenticolari sono i resti di vecchie galassie a spirale che hanno perso gran parte del loro gas, e molte galassie ellittiche sono resti di altrettante galassie a spirale che hanno interagito tra loro.\n\nGli ammassi di galassie sono spesso costituiti anche da una grande quantit\u00e0 di gas caldo che si disperde fra le galassie, mentre nel campo non si trova la presenza di questo gas caldo. Quando la radiazione emessa da questo gas caldo colpisce una galassia a spirale, questa strappa via una gran quantit\u00e0 di gas freddo contenuto al suo interno, secondo un processo chiamato \u201cram-pressur stripping\u201d. Tale processo converte rapidamente galassie a spirale e ricche di gas in galassie lenticolari che ne sono invece povere. Le galassie a spirale faticano a sopravvivere in un ambiente formato da gas caldo.\n\nQuello che emerge, \u00e8 che le galassie evolvono e cambiano la loro morfologia nel tempo. Le galassie che noi oggi osserviamo nell\u2019universo vicino hanno gi\u00e0 una lungo storia alle spalle, e sono il risultato della loro evoluzione.", "curriculum": "L'attivit\u00e0 proposta \u00e8 coerente con gli obiettivi di apprendimento dei nuovi licei:\n\n- http://nuovilicei.indire.it/content/index.php?action=lettura&amp;id_m=7782&amp;id_cnt=10497", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "Gli studenti sono in grado di identificare le galassie servendosi di calcoli, lavorando con fogli di lavoro e formulando ipotesi sull\u2019effetto morfologia-densit\u00e0.", "alert_message": "", "short_desc_material": "", "further_reading": "0", "reference": "", "big_idea": "", "spaceawe_authorship": ""}}, {"model": "activities.activitytranslation", "pk": 67, "fields": {"language_code": "en", "master": 68, "slug": "meteoroids-meteors-and-meteorites", "title": "Meteoroids, Meteors and Meteorites", "teaser": "Learn about formation of meteroids.", "theme": "Solar System", "keywords": "Meteors, meteorites, asteroids, shooting stars, comets", "acknowledgement": "UNAWE, Europlanet", "description": "", "goals": " - Learn the difference between meteoroids, meteors and meteorites\n - Learn that shooting stars are not stars but meteors\n - Learn that meteorites can affect life on Earth\n - Learn about the origins of meteoroids \n", "objectives": "- Explain the differences between meteoroids, meteors and meteorites\n- Demonstrate how meteoroids are formed using flint stones.

Most asteroids orbit the Sun in a ring located between Mars and Jupiter; however, some orbit in other places. Because of the gravitational interactions with both Jupiter and the Sun, these asteroids never managed to assemble, stick together and form a planet like the Earth.\n\n**Comets** orbit the Sun in a much different way. They have elliptical (oval shaped) orbits, which bring lead from the outer reaches of the Solar System close to the Sun and then back out again. Comets are made up of rocks, cemented together by ice. As they near the Sun, the ice on the surface begins to melt, giving them a huge characteristic tail of water, steam and dust.\n\nThe space between our planets is populated by billions of smaller particles, which orbit around the Sun. They are called meteoroids, and according to the International Astronomical Union, they are larger than a micron (a thousandth of a millimetre) and smaller than a meter in diameter. \n\nA **meteor** is the flash of light that we see in the night sky when a small chunk of interplanetary debris burns up as it passes through our atmosphere, also known as a shooting star. Most meteoroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere are so small that they vaporise completely and never reach the planet's surface. \n\nThese meteors come from **meteoroids**, there are three main sources of meteoroids. Many are left over from the dust that formed the Solar System. Others are fragments of asteroids, broken off in collisions. Huge meteor showers, caused by many meteoroids entering the atmosphere in one go, are caused by comets. They occur when the Earth\u2019s atmosphere passes through a stream of small particles left behind in the comet\u2019s tail.\n\nIf any part of a meteoroid survives the fall through the atmosphere and lands on Earth, it is called a **meteorite**. Although majority of the meteorites are very small, their size can range from about a fraction of a gram (the size of a pebble) to 100 kilograms or more (the size of a huge, life-destroying boulder).\n\nAlthough active processes on Earth\u2019s surface quickly destroy the impact craters formed by meteorites, about 190 terrestrial impact craters have been identified so far. These range in diameter from a few tens of meters up to about 300 km, and they range in age from the recent times to more than two billion years. The discovery of a 180-km wide crater in Mexico is suggested to be responsible for the extinction of dinosaurs over 66 million years ago.\n", "fulldesc": "###Preparation\nFor the comet demonstration, students will need to mix small pieces of gravel and/or sand with water in a cup (or another suitable mould). This should then be frozen before the activity starts.\n\nThe students should complete their worksheets by answering each question.\n\n###Meteoroids, Asteroids and Comets\n\nAsk the students to name the objects that may be found in the Solar System and list them on a board. Tell the students that the main topic of the lesson is Meteors/Shooting Stars.\n\nPass around the rocks, explaining that they symbolise asteroids. Explain what an asteroid is using the background information and the following image (Asteroid Gaspra).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/bbd98a29-853d-47fc-a861-b575e1f35f09/Asteroid.jpg)\n\nPass the comets around the class so the students can see what it is made of.

Explain that many meteoroids are simply small pieces left over from the formation of the Solar System, which did not get formed into planets.\n\nEnsuring that the students are wearing safety goggles and have been warned of the dangers of sharp fragments, ask them to knock the \u2018asteroid\u2019 rocks together to see how meteoroids are formed from asteroids.\n\nShow them how the comet has now melted and that the small rock fragments inside it have become meteoroids.\n\n###Meteors\n\nAsk the students if they have ever heard of shooting stars, or if anyone has ever seen one. If anyone knows what they are, ask them to try and explain.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/bbd98a29-853d-47fc-a861-b575e1f35f09/Meteor.jpg)\n\nExplain that meteoroids move incredibly fast, and the Earth also orbits the Sun at a high speed. So if a meteoroid hits Earth, it will be moving very fast. Impact speeds can be up to 70 kilometres per second, which is the equivalent to 150,000 miles per hour or 250,000 kilometres per hour. This is the equivalent of flying round the equator 8 times every hour. \nWhen an object travelling so fast hits our atmosphere, the air resistance is massive (students may be able to relate this to the force felt in a car when driving with the windows down). The immense force causes the meteorite to burn, making it a meteor.\n\nTell the class that very few of the meteors formed are seen. Ask them to think about why this is the case. (70% of Earth\u2019s surface area consists of oceans, with no one living on them, and during the day time, meteors cannot usually be seen).\n\nAsk the students why they are referred to as shooting stars. \nDiscuss with the class what people in the past may have thought shooting stars were. (Weather event like lightning, magic/mythical origins, etc.)\n\n###Meteorites\n\nExplain that sometimes meteorites do not completely burn up in the atmosphere, and can \u2018land\u2019 on Earth. A meteor that does this is known as a meteorite. Show the class the photograph of a meteorite.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/bbd98a29-853d-47fc-a861-b575e1f35f09/Meteorite.jpg)\n \nThis meteorite was found in a Saudi Arabian Desert. Notice how it stands out against the yellow rocks. Explain to the class how it is much easier to find meteorites in places where they stand out. Ask the students to discuss where it would be easy and difficult to find meteorites. (Easy \u2013 deserts, plains, sand dunes and on ice in Antarctica. Difficult \u2013 forests, lakes and seas).\n\nSome meteorites are large enough and travel fast enough to create a crater on Earth when they impact. Ask the class what would the effect size be of a crater caused by a meteor. (Mass, impact speed, impact direction, type of ground it lands on).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/bbd98a29-853d-47fc-a861-b575e1f35f09/Crater.jpg)\n\u2018Meteor Crater\u2019 in Arizona, USA. It was the first in the world to be positively identified as a meteor crater. \n \n*It is possible to recall the extinction of the dinosaurs by the dust cloud from a meteor strike if the class has previously learned about this.* \n\n###Case Study \u2013 Chelyabinsk Meteor\n\nWatch the following video of the Chelyabinsk Meteor in Russia in 2013:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=ztrU90Ub4Uw\nDiscuss how it was bright enough to be seen during the day \u2013 try to relate the brightness to the speed and size of the meteor. It was roughly 20 meters in diameter and travelling at 60,000 km/h (40,000 mph), with a weight of 10,000 tonnes.\n\nThe video may not be suitable for younger children.\nExplain to the class the dangers of meteor strikes. They have an immense amount of energy and can cause massive destruction. Watch the following video of the shockwave caused by the meteor explosion:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq02C_3FvFo&amp;t=106s\n \nExplain that the shockwave was caused by when the meteor exploded approximately 25 km above the Earth\u2019s surface. The shockwave reached the people much after they saw the light because of the difference between the speeds of light and sound. Explain that the shockwave caused windows to shatter, and 1,500 people  needed hospital treatment  for injuries (mostly because of broken glass from windows).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/bbd98a29-853d-47fc-a861-b575e1f35f09/Chelyabinsk_fragment.jpg) \nImage: a small meteorite \u2013 a fragment of the Chelyabinsk Meteor after it exploded\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "Consider following this activity with an experiment about impact craters, e.g.: the Lunar Landscape activity (http://astroedu.iau.org/activities/lunar-landscape/).", "conclusion": "The students learn the differences between meteoroids, meteors and meteorites and how the impact of asteroids/meteoroids can affect life on Earth.", "alert_message": "", "short_desc_material": "There is an attachment called Worksheet for this activity.

The following numbered activities each are based on each previous one. The students can go as far as available time permits. Alternatively, the whole class may participate in the activity together, led by the teacher.\n- 1) Ask the student to choose a planetary body they will work with. The basic goal is to find a location for a country/state-sized human self-sustaining (imaginary) infrastructure. The most common choice could be Mars since it is the most Earth-like world with diverse landscapes, however, the Moon may also be a good choice since humans already visited it. The student may also choose more exotic worlds. \n\n- 2) Ask students to choose a \u201clanding site\u201d on a planetary body for their home country/state. They should be able to argue for their choice, which may include local science goals (geology, astrobiology), engineering concerns (geological, safety of constructing buildings or routes), meteorological or astronomical (day/night) factors or just similarities in topography. \n\n- 3) Ask students to draw a physical geographic sketch map (on paper) of the country/state after moving it to any of the available planetary bodies, based on what individual features they can identify on the screen view (topography/relief, albedo). They can also use a grid, scale etc. The map should contain at least the generalized outline or symbol of the main features seen on the map, within the outlines. This activity may require more explanation from the instructor on the features\u2019 formative processes and boundaries. \n\n- 4) Ask students to display the official IAU names if/where appropriate. This activity ensures that they can pair names with features. However, a smaller region may not include named features.\n \n- 5) Ask students to describe the new geography of the country and list the landform types (mountain, crater, volcano etc.) within the borders of the country/state on the planetary body. Students should use the names of local geographical features of their country/state or names of cardinal directions in order to be able to explain which new landforms are in which part of their \u201cnew\u201d country/state. Although it is not a part of the App\u2019s sensu stricto goals, students should also understand the nature of the features they see on the map. Using morphology or relief as a key for identification, students should produce the previously mentioned list of the graphically identified features on their map, with preferably three parameters:  \n - 1) a description (high cone, lineated terrain, circular cavity \u2013 with their own words),  \n - 2) a geological term that reveals their origin (impact crater, volcano, ice cap, dune field etc.), which shows that the student understands the nature of the feature; and  \n - 3) a placename for that feature.\n\n- 6) Ask students to add settlements and roads in the map and explain why they have chosen those locations or routes for transportation, what kind of vehicles they plan to use and what kind of road they will build (just poles to show directions or actual road).  \n\n- 7) Ask students to identify up to five landmarks that can be used for surface operations, i.e. are visible from the surface and distinct. \n\n- 8) Ask students to name their new settlements and roads (by either actual names or some other form of designation they invent.) \nAlternative activity: \n \n- 9) FIELD TRIP TO EARTH\nUsers may simulate a planetary exploration here on Earth. In Earth map view they can start from the place they live. Users mat plan exploration routes and define \u201cscience areas of interest\u201d to visit within 100 km circle (similar to the concept of human Exploration Zones, listed among the countries in the App). They can describe each \u201ctraverse\u201d, their potential science results and hazards. This task can be continued in an actual field trip where students can record their observations during the planned route and discuss differences between planning and actual execution of the plans in the field. We note that for a planetary analog study, no special equipment (e.g., simulated space suit) is needed, as shown by NASA\u2019s BASALT (Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains) research program. Students can explore the mission planning, scheduling, execution, real-time and post-mission analysis of data from many perspectives, including logistics, effective recording of data, communication between astronauts and mission control. In locations where no planetary analog terrain is present, a vegetated terrain provides analog to a fictional exoplanetary exploration. This application can be considered a gamification of a traditional class field trip in biology, ecology, geology, geography. Students may be asked to also observe humans as an \u201calien species\u201d and find reasonable explanations of their observable behaviors, extending the range of disciplines to social sciences (for example: why do people move to cities where no food is available locally).\n\nThese tasks may be made either orally during class or as a short composition / drawing that the teacher can subsequently collect and evaluate. \n", "materials": "- Computer/laptop/smartphone \u2013 one per student, -\nstudent group or class, depending on setting  \n- Internet access  \n- Projector optional for class-wide activity  \n- Paper  \n- Pen  \n", "background": "Estimating sizes and distances on planetary surfaces is a difficult task on spacecraft imagery because of the lack of familiar landmarks of known sizes, the ubiquity of scale-independent landforms (craters, cracks, cones, dunes), and also due to the different radius of planets and satellites.  \nTo estimate the extent of features and distinct regions is therefore almost impossible on a planetary surface without a scale. A map that the student is familiar with greatly helps estimating sizes and distances since it projects the known environment onto the planetary surface, virtually placing the student into a known 3D environment. The basic goal, however, is not just to add a sense of sizes to a map view, but to help the virtual exploration in the environment of another planetary surface. Ultimately, by exploring a lifeless planet in imagination with a sense of the real scale, the unique characteristics of our own, well-accustomed terrestrial environments will be emphasized. \nA few unusual phenomena that will likely be encountered in viewing orbital images or planetary maps are: the inability to discriminate sizes of simple craters and the abundance of craters; problems in viewing craters and hills in inverted relief, the large sizes of canyons, troughs, volcanoes, lava flows; the large sizes of terrains with undifferentiated (similar, or repetitive) relief features in general (without vegetation and man-made features that would otherwise segment an undifferentiated geologic substrate). \nStudents should also focus to deliminate single features by identifying boundaries where a terrain changes. These are the contact lines of geologic units or features, and even think about their origin, stratigraphic relations (which was produced first, and which cut into that or covered that subsequently) or relief changes. This is a basic requirement to be able to identify and discriminate standalone \u201cfeatures\u201d on the landscape.\n\n###How the App works\n\nThe outline of a chosen country, U.S. state or a standard 100 km radius Mars Exploration Zone can be displayed and moved on the surface of another planet or moon (currently, Mars, Venus, the Moon, Io, Titan and Jupiter), keeping its original size. This comparison can be done either on the surface of a rotatable globe model or on a 2D map in Web Mercator projection. \n\n###FUNCTIONS\n\n**Select and display maps:** The user can select thematic raster maps from eight planetary bodies. Scale and legend is included in the maps in rasterized form. \n \n**Navigation:** \n- Zoom in-out: mouse scrolling or +/- button on screen\n- Position of the globe within the screen: Shift+drag mouse\n- Rotate globe: drag mouse\n- Change center of perspective: ctrs+shift+drag mouse\n- Start/end line measurement: mouse click\n- Reset distance measurement tool: turn the tool off and on\n\n**Country overlay: The user can overlay the vector outline of any country or U.S. State or a standard 100-km-radius Exploration Zone on any embedded planetary body. The outline can be displayed and moved on the surface, keeping its original size, in both 2D and 3D views. When drawing the country outlines, the radius differences of the bodies are taken in account.\n\n**Projection:** The maps have two views: a 2D flat map in Web Mercator projection, and a 3D rotatable virtual globe model (no surface relief is shown in 3D). These two different view modes offer various uses. The flat version can also be used to demonstrate the high area distortions of the Mercator projection e.g. by moving Greenland to lower latitudes (Fig. 3). However, due to the properties of Mercator projection (poles are projected to infinite distance), polar regions cannot be explored effectively in the flat view, only on the 3D globe.\nThe virtual globe mode is a useful tool to demonstrate the size differences of the planetary bodies. For instance, Australia on the Moon would cover almost an entire hemisphere (Fig. 4).  \nDistance measurement:  This tool is used to draw a polyline, calculates and displays distance and travel time between the two end points, in various units that includes the maximum speed of a walking astronaut, an automatic rover, a human-driven rover and a car on a blacktop freeway.\n\n**Coordinate display:** It shows the position (IAU geographic coordinate) of the cursor.  Earth and Moon coordinates are displayed in the \u00b1180 longitude system, Mars and Venus in the 0-360\u00b0 Eastern longitudes system and the other bodies in the 0-360\u00b0 Western longitudes system. \nColors: The user can determine the color of the measurement polyline and the country outline. \nScreenshot: Using the screenshot feature built into the App, users can save the current view as a png image file that includes any traverses the user created but excludes the user interface), providing a printable background map for further activities. The user can continue working on this map in an external image processing application where they can add settlements, roads, regions of scientific interests etc., learning the concepts of planetary physical geography, toponymy, cartography, mission and city planning. These aspects are discussed in Chapter 4 in detail.\n\n**Place names:** Place names are rasterized or \u201cburnt into pixels\u201d, so that we could use the full spectrum fonts can provide, including font faces, sizes and styles, to distinguish places of different type, size and landscape hierarchy level. This function is not available in nomenclature vector layers that are not feature polygon-linked, as is the case for the majority of planetary map platforms. The major disadvantage of the rasterized nomenclature, however, is that it is not scale-dependent: by zooming into the view, the names become disproportionally large and place names cannot be searched for. \n\n**Info (about):** This window contains information on the Tool, including links to references and online tutorials.  \n\n###PLANET OVERVIEWS\n\nThe Mercury globe is a green-to-red color hillshade MESSENGER Global DEM topographic map. Mercury is characterized by densely cratered terrains and less cratered smooth volcanic plains. Some large basins resemble those on the Moon. Wrinkle ridges (long ridges) occur in all parts of the planet, likely resulted from the cooling of the crust. \n\nThe Venus view is a monochromatic colorized mosaic of Magellan radar images in which bright tones show rough areas (trough systems, tectonically deformed tesserae, and lava flows), medium tones show lava plains, and dark tones represent smooth, dust covered regions. \n\nThe Moon topographic map is based on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Wide Angle Camera (LROC WAC) DEM data. The Moon is a relatively small body, with two distinct terrains colored according to their different altitude range blue and yellow: lowland plains (maria) and highlands, respectively. This topographic difference coincides with the albedo difference visible to the naked eye: volcanic (basaltic) maria are dark and megabreccia-dominated anorthositic highlands are bright. This difference is partly due to the different materials and the different roughness of the two terrain types: basalt is darker and these plains are also smoother, while anorthosite is brighter and highlands are also densely cratered. Prominent features of the map are the rings of multiring basins usually with a mare plain at their centers. The enormous, ancient South Pole-Aitken Basin is also evident in the relief map but remains hidden in the photomosaic view. \n\nMars has two views: one topographic and one albedo. The topographic color hillshade map of Mars is based on MOLA gridded DEM and displays the lowlands and basins in white to yellow, highlands in brown, high shield volcanoes in dark brown. The albedo globe shows the permanent, bright ice caps, medium-toned dust covered regions and dust-free dark areas that may be covered with basaltic sand. The albedo map is produced from the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera (MGS MOC) photomosaic and shows both albedo and topographic place names.\nThe map of Io is a false color Galileo\u2013Voyager photomosaic  in which the most distinct features are the red, sulfur-rich plume deposits of active volcanic centers (symbolized by red asterisks) and dark lava-filled calderas. The yellow coloration of the surface is caused by sulfur coating while the brightest areas are covered by a volatile, sulfur dioxide frost, deposited from volcanic degassing. Most irregular patterns represent lava flows, while the over 100 mountain blocks are most apparent in the south polar region where they are shown casting long shadows in this mosaic. Mountain peaks are indicated by black triangles and peak heights are displayed in meters. These symbols are taken from terrestrial maps and are not usual parts of planetary maps. \n\nThe map of Jupiter shows the cloud bands with nomenclature, in which any country can be easily placed into the white ovals and the Great Red Spot. The map background is the color image of Jupiter produced by the Hubble Space Telescope OPAL Program. Since Jupiter has no solid surface, this map only shows the size of the planet and its atmospheric features (clouds, cyclones) relative to others. NOT SUITABLE FOR LANDING \u2013 NO SOLID SURFACE. \n\nThe composite (infrared+radar) Titan globe shows the Cassini infrared (ISS) view of the satellite that shows dark equatorial dunes, dark polar liquid methane filled lakes and bright terrains made of rocks of H2O ice. Stripes of Cassini radar images give a higher resolution view in the north polar regions.\n\nIn addition to the above listed maps, Google\u2019s photomosaics of Mars (THEMIS daytime thermal infrared mosaic at 100 m/px raster data resolution) and the Moon (Clementine albedo mosaic, 100 m/px resolution) are also embedded into the App without any modification, and provide the highest resolution background maps.\n \n###MAP TYPES\n\nThe maps have somewhat different themes. This difference is partly due to the differences in planetary mission designs, instruments and surface conditions: for instance, the atmosphere of Venus and Titan is opaque in visible wavelength and therefore an optical image mosaic of the surface is not available for this body. \n\n**Photomosaic** maps show the surface at a particular wavelength(s)and solar incidence angle. Low-sun mosaics are composed of images taken when the Sun is near the horizon. These images emphasize relief by showing long shadows. High-sun images show albedo, or reflectivity, of the surface that may represent differing composition, grain size, or surface roughness. Albedo features may or may not correspond to topographic features (relief). These maps are usually monochromatic (greyscale), and may show the surface in visible, near infrared or thermal infrared wavelengths. Mosaics of images taken at different wavelengths may be combined into a color image. These are usually false color mosaics and include visible and infrared bands. Examples: Mars, Moon, Io\n\n**Imaging radar** maps show the radar reflectance properties of the planetary surface. A radar instrument onboard the orbiting spacecraft \u201cilluminates\u201d the surface by cm-scale radar pulses emitted by the spacecraft\u2019s transmitter. A portion of this electromagnetic radiation is reflected from the surface and is received by the antenna the radar instrument. The radar echo or radar return depends on the roughness of the surface relative to the radar wavelength used for the mapping. Typically, dusty or sandy (particles less than a centimeter) areas do not reflect cm-scale radar waves and remain dark and rocky surfaces (particles greater than a cm) produce strong radar return signal and are represented as bright areas on radar maps. Radar maps are typically displayed in monochromatic (greyscale) form. Examples: Venus, Titan (partially). \n\n**Topographic maps** show surface elevation and relief. Although the initial topographic dataset (digital elevation model, DEM) has no associated colors and could be displayed in greyscale shades, these maps are typically displayed in a custom-made color ramp (color coding) combined with hill-shading that enhance the sense of relief. This visualization provides the most familiar cartographic picture of a surface. The color ramp for topographic maps of different bodies could be similar, however, we chose different color ramps to reflect a color-related mental association of the particular body. These colors are symbolic and do not correspond to the real color of the body, neither follow the color ramp of terrestrial physical geographic maps where colors are related to the presence of water or are symbolic, simplified representations of zonal vegetation. Students should familiarize with the color ramp before studying the map (rasterized legends are available in the maps). Planetary topographic data may be obtained from radar altimetry, laser altimetry or stereo imaging etc., techniques. Examples: Mercury, Mars, Moon.  \n\n**Merged themes.** A map product may combine different themes. Relief can be shown by colors or shadows (either in a low-sun photomosaic or by producing hillshading from a digital elevation model). Surface material / compositional units may be emphasized in albedo maps, high-sun (local noon) or nighttime infrared photomosaics taken when shadows are equally absent. While noon images show the reflectance of surface materials, nighttime thermal infrared images show thermal inertia properties.\n", "fulldesc": "Before the activities the teacher should check the App to make sure it is compatible with the video card / computer that will be used. Three options can be chosen: \n- a flat Google API, http://countrymovers.elte.hu/g.html \n- a flat Cesium API, and a 3d (virtual globe) Cesium API. http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html \n\nWhichever the most stable should be chosen for classroom demonstration. \nThis acivity consists of a mixture of student activities on handout, teacher demonstrations and student discussions. \n\nFULL ANALOGUE VERSION\nIf computers are not available, the teacher can prepare an analog version of the App: print out a planetary map detail at the appropriate scale and draw or print the outlines of your country/state on a transparency film and cut it out. The students may move this transparency film on the map to find its new location. The best result is when a planetary globe is avaialble on which the transparency film can be moved. \n \n###ACTIVITY 1 \u2013 PREPARATION\n\n1.\tDisplay the map using a classroom projector or computer screen(s).\n2.\tDisplay your country or state on Earth. \n3.\tSTUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT  On a piece of paper, draw the outlines of your chosen country/state. Don\u2019t include any geographic features, draw only the outlines. It can be a rough outline, the details are not necessary. \n4.\tChoose a planetary body (planet or moon) for all further activities. We recommend the topographic map of Mars or of the Moon for starting activities. Do not use Jupiter in this exercise, it has no solid surface. \n\n\nSpecific activities:\n\n###ACTIVITY 2 \u2013 DISPLAY COUNTRY/STATE ON ANOTHER PLANET\nChoose your country/state from the drop-down menu and choose the target body from the other drop-down menu. \n1. The outline will be initially displayed at the coordinate where it is located on Earth. This is the easiest, but it may place the country onto a featureless area. Advantage: fast, no need for student input. You may keep this view or move the outline. If the area is featureless, you should move it to another place. In this case, rotate the globe first to give a global overview of the geography of the planet or moon. \nNow read or tell students about the general geography of the chosen body, and a short explanation on what the map shows, based on the Planet overviews in the \u201cBackground materials\u201d section of this document. You may also summarize how to interpret the image data (from Map types descriptions).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/cali%20mars.jpg)\nCalifornia at its terrestrial coordinates, placed onto Mars.\n\n2. You may move the outline to another location where local geography is more varied or resembles the actual terrestrial relief. Choose a site that contains several different prominent feature types. Drawback: may be time consuming. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/calimars2.jpg)\nCalifornia moved to a geologically more diverse location\n\n###ACTIVITY 3 \u2013 COMPARE SIZES\nChoose a prominent geographic feature within the outlines and measure its width, and say their sizes in absolute distance (km/mile), relative distance (compared to real features in that country/state) and travel time units (displayed in the App). \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/calimars3.jpg) \nOlympus Mons is as large as the distance from San Francisco to LA and it would take 5 hours to travel from one side to the other by car if there were a blacktop highway on Olympus Mons.\n\n###ACTIVITY 4 \u2013 COMPARE PROJECTIONS\n1. Compare routes: Create a measurement line (route) between two distant points. Change the view from 2D to 3D in the Cesium app view. Observe how the route is changing from like to arc as you change view and rotate the 3D globe view.\n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/elysium%20olympus%20a.jpg)\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/elysium%20olympus%20b.jpg)\nThe route from Elysium to Olympus Mons. a) 2D flat view, b) 3D globe view\n\n2. Compare outlines: Move the outlines in N-S direction in the 2D flat view. You may move the outline of your country/state on the Earth map. Observe as the outline changes. Now repeat this in the 3D view (no size change is observed). \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/cali%20high.jpg)\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/cali%20low.jpg)\nCalifornia at low (below) and high (above) latitudes in 3D flat map view.\n\n###ACTIVITY 5 \u2013 DESCRIBE GEOLOGY \n1.\tSplit the country into terrain types. Identify major features (\u201cunits\u201d) within the country/state outlines by differentiating the different textures/patterns/relief types/colored areas etc. on the map.  \n2.\tSTUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT Draw the outlines (called \"contacts\") of the identified units using paper and pencil. Identify only major/prominent features, not more than 5. \n3.\tDescribe each unit in morphologic terms (high, low, cone-shaped, bowl-shaped, basin, flat terrain, hilly, knob, rolling etc.)\n4.\tProvide interpretation. To answer the question \u201cwhy are they different\u201d, create a model of the unit\u2019s geology that includes the followings for each identified feature: \n1)\torigin (the geologic process that produced the feature, for example impact, volcanic, aeolian, fluvial, marine, glacial, tectonic etc.),\n2)\tmaterial (basalt lava for volcanoes and lunar maria, impact breccia for craters, H2O and CO2 ice for polar caps of Mars, sand for dunes, ice rich regolith for patterned ground, methane for lakes on Titan etc.).\n3)\tADVANCED / IF APPLICABLE: the sequence of the formation of the landscape (geologic evolution). The sequence can be established from\n1.\tstratigraphy, observing which features is younger, for example where a crater is emplaced upon another or a lava flow floods an older crater, or a fracture cuts through a preexisting feature; \n2.\tusing crater counting (crater frequency) where densely cratered surfaces are older and less cratered is younger\n3.\tSTUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT: name each feature type with a descriptive name and display the initial letters of the words for types on the map. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/cali%20features.jpg)\nThe most prominent features visible on this background map layer with four landform/terrain types. Explanation of letters: C: crater, P: peaks, Pl: plain, Ch: chasm. The new location of California is on a diverse terrain. We changed state color to grey for better transparency. \n\n###ACTIVITY 6 \u2013 COMPARE GEOLOGY TO EARTH \nDiscuss the difference between Earth and the target area. Basically, ALL regions in ALL planets are DESERTS from terrestrial perspective.  Exceptions may be: active lava lakes (Io), rivers and lakes (Titan) and high rocky mountains (slopes). All other surfaces are cold or hot deserts\nSo the major difference is related to the absence of vegetation, liquid water and human made features (roads etc). \nA few topics for discussion:\n- What would the relief look like on Earth (with vegetation and water). \n- Give an example of a similar terrain on Earth.\n- What are the major landmarks on this terrain? (As seen from the surface). \n- What material could you use for building a settlement on the planet/moon? \n\n\n###ACTIVITY 7  \u2013 Route (traverse) planning: Visualizing distance and measuring travel time\nA tool built into the application can measure geodesic distances (great circle sections) of a polyline feature drawn by the user (Fig. 5). This tool can be used for traverse planning (from local to global scale), and shows the distance not only in km or mile, but also in practical units: travel time at walking speed (4 km/h), at the maximum speed of Martian rovers (0.1 km/h), the Lunar Roving Vehicle driven by the Apollo astronauts (15 km/h) and for comparison, regular cars on freeways (104 km/h or 65 mph). This gives a realistic view of how fast a place can be reached in surface operations. (The tool does not take topography, slopes, boulders or other obstacles, or surface material properties (sand, dust etc.) into consideration \u2013 this should be evaluated by the user). This route planning tool is a counterpart of the Directions tool in Google Maps, however, there are no pre-defined routes (blacktop roads) on other planetary bodies \u2013 all routes are cross-country. \nCities and roads activity\nSTUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT: Select two sites within your country/state for two settlements. These sites should be \n- at the meeting point of two or more different terrain types, \n- on a safe place (no steep slope, sand dunes. When surface ice is present, build only houses on stilts). \n\n###STUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT: \nConnect the two sites with a line or polyline (with several nods). This is the road between your settlements. The road should also be safe.\n\nOrally describe the trip on this road, following the different terrain types as you move along. Identify the length of the trip in distance and travel time units. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/cali%20hellas%20basin.jpg)\nCalifornia East of Hellas Basin with two imaginary settlements and a road.\n\n###ACTIVITY 8\u2013 TOPONYMS (PLACENAMES)\n\nSTUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT 1. Official nomenclature activity. If the features in your selected area have any names displayed, copy these names onto your paper map and say them aloud. What could these words mean? What is the language of these words? (Answer: descriptor terms are in Latin, specifics are from all around the world). \nSTUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT 2. Add New names. \nName \n- unnamed prominent geographic features,  \n- your road and \n- your cities. \n\nNames may be random or coherently chosen from a pool of similar terms (i.e., names of gods, names of friends, names of flowers, names of poets, cardinal points  etc.). \n \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4a4ba328-9635-43d6-9a6c-94ae9c6c03ae/cali%20mixed%20official.jpg)\nMixed official (white) and new (informal, pink) placenames.\n\nFINSH MAP \u2013 Cartography\nSTUDENT ACTIVITY ON HANDOUT Ask students to add the following elements: \n- title (it may include a new name for the country/state), \n- scale bar \u2013 Use the measurement tool to prepare the scale bar. (Draw a 100 km polyline) \n- grid (a network of evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines reaching the margin of the map, used to identify locations) \n- Grid labels: column and row labels (A, B, C, ... letters for columns and 1, 2, 3.. numbers for rows) on the margin of the grid. \n- legend of the used symbols (for terrain types, cities, roads etc.)\n\n###HOME WORK ACTIVITY \n1. Landing site selection and city planning \nDevelop a complex city / road network. Make cities specialized to certain tasks that are in connection with their location.\nIn this task, students can move their countries to a place that they think would be suitable for a human settlement based on a multicriteria analysis/evaluation of the new environment (Asking if they wanted to move the entire country to that planet, what would be the ideal site for that). They can argue why that geographic environment was preferred and draw imaginary settlements and roads between them and argue why cities/roads were placed at certain locations thus practice city and road network planning. For example, a city is placed next to a channel, where it is the narrowest and roads follow valleys and avoid large craters or scarps. Students may explore particular details like how and where power will be generated, how food will be produced, processed and transported, how communication media will operate, what jobs will be required etc. \nStudents may name unnamed features or the features they create (cities, roads). Names may be random or they can develop a name or designation system, learning about the significance and origins of place names.  A coherent designation system may use pools of similar terms. \nPlace names can make the project very personal and motivated. For example roads may be numbered in clockwise direction on the map and cities may be named after the students\u2019 friends or the teachers of the school or can be names of flowers, names of poets etc.) or students can develop any other set of rules for the nomenclature which might evolve into another project that is more arts or humanities than science, bringing the concept of STEAM (Science, technology, engineering, arts and math) into this activity.\n2. One day exploration trip activity\nUse high resolution background map (Google). Plan a one-day trip. Participants can choose vehicle and target and determine the distance of the trip from the measurement tool. They should consider travel time with the selected vehicle to the target, back to the habitat, time spent on foot, time spent with documentation (photography)/taking samples and time lost in potential accidents. They should leave after sunrise and return by sunset. For this task, they should learn the local length of day that depends on rotation, season and latitude. Students may place facilities along the roads preferably within one day travel distance. \n\n###TEACHER ASSISTED ACTIVITY: Gamification and presentation\nAsk students or student groups to further develop and clarify their works and organize an exhibit of the best works. \nThese works can be also exhibited in the school or a contest can be designed to fully incorporate the concept of gamification. Student can also show their final works by drawing them and explaining the concepts behind at the blackboard, also practicing cartographic generalization.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "Website: http://countrymovers.elte.hu \nPlanetary nomenclature details can be found at http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/ \nM\u00e1ty\u00e1s Gede and Henrik Hargitai, An Online Planetary Exploration Tool: \u201cCountry Movers\u201d, Acta Astronautica, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.04.028 \n", "conclusion": "Students learn about local and planetary physical geography / geology, toponymy, planetary landing site selection and cartography.

A questo proposito puoi leggere: \n- http://www.universetoday.com/20289/phases-of-the-moon/ (in inglese)\n- http://archive.oapd.inaf.it/othersites/sc/starchild/questions/question3.html (in italiano)\n\n**Stelle**\n\nLe stelle sono grandi sfere luminose fatte di gas, tenute insieme dalla forza di gravit\u00e0. Al centro delle stelle sono attive delle reazioni di fusione nucleare, a cui si deve anche la luce che emettono. Stelle che differiscono per colore, differiscono per temperatura: quelle blu sono le pi\u00f9 calde, quelle rosse sono le pi\u00f9 fredde.\n\n**Pianeti**\n\nI pianeti sono grandi corpi in orbita intorno al Sole. Si distinguono dalle stelle perch\u00e9 la loro posizione cambia leggermente, di notte in notte, rispetto allo sfondo delle stelle fisse. \nLa loro luminosit\u00e0 cambia secondo un ciclo regolare. Venere, Marte, Giove e Saturno si possono vedere anche a occhio nudo. Anche Mercurio, ma solo in particolari condizioni fortunate.\n\n**Constellazioni**\n\nL'International Astronomical Union (IAU) riconosce 88 costellazioni in tutto, fra emisfero nord ed emisfero sud. \nLe costellazioni sono figure realizzate collegando  le stelle fra loro con un tratto immaginario. Le figure sono spesso collegate ad antiche leggende e miti.\nEcco un link per approfondire le costellazioni:\n- http://stardate.org/nightsky/constellations (in inglese)\n- http://archive.oapd.inaf.it/costellazioni/ (in italiano)", "fulldesc": "Preparazione\n\n- Ti consigliamo di scaricare il software Stellarium (cerca di coinvolgere gli studenti anche in questa operazione, se possibile). \nCon Stellarium, identifica gli oggetti celesti visibili ad occhio nudo tenendo conto della localit\u00e0 da dove vuoi osservare il cielo e dell'ora a cui lo farai.\n\n- Stampa la carta del cielo, una per studente e annotate insieme gli oggetti che vorreste osservare dal vivo.

Anzi: pi\u00f9 ne sai, pi\u00f9 idee ti verranno.\n\n###Step 3:\nPer iniziare a far circolare un po' di idee, scrivi un aggettivo (per esempio bello, grande, distante) associato a 5-10 sostantivi (nomi) fra quelli elencati qui sotto (il coordinatore di questa attivit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 eliminare alcuni nomi o sostituirli con altri):\n\n- stella\n- gigante rossa\n- nana bianca\n- ammasso aperto\n- ammasso globulare\n- oscurit\u00e0\n- pianeta (selezionane uno fra gli 8 del sistema solare)\n- Luna\n- cielo\n- stella cadente / meteora\n- cometa\n- asteroide\n- fascia di Kuiper \n- nebulosa\n- nebulosa planetaria\n- supernova\n- galassia a spirale\n- galassia barrata\n- galassia ellittica \n- buco nero\n- stella di neutroni\n- quasar\n\n###Step 4:\nScrivi tre parole per descrivere come ti fa sentire o che cosa ti fa pensare osservare il cielo stellato.\n\n###Step 5:\nDiscutete su come si possono legare in modo diverso le cose che sapete di astronomia e quel che volete esprimere - quel che pensate o quel che sentite. \n\nIn questa fase, non dovete scrivere le idee sotto forma di poesia: piuttosto concentratevi e buttate gi\u00f9 pensieri, suggestioni, anche sotto forma di elenco o parole sparse sul foglio. Poi, solo in un secondo momento, troverete le parole che trasformeranno il tutto in poesia vera e propria.\n\nPer esempio: \"guardare le stelle che si muovono nel cielo nel corso della notte mi fa pensare a quanto veloce la Terra ruoti intorno al proprio asse - e io sopra di lei. Pensare a quelle velocit\u00e0 mi sorprende, cos\u00ec come mi sorprende che sia la forza di gravit\u00e0 a farci rimanere inchiodati a terra. E quanto piccoli siamo, dopo tutto! \n\n###Step 6:\nIspirandovi a quel che avete fatto nel passo precedente, iniziate a scrivere una poesia sul cielo stellato.\nPotete scegliere qualsiasi stile vogliate e qualsiasi tema, purch\u00e9 sia legato all'astronomia. Potete pensare alla poesia come un modo per accompagnare il lettore in un viaggio nello spazio o per fargli sperimentare in prima persona i fenomeni astronomici che descrivete.  Sentitevi liberi e creativi. \n\n###Step 7:\nCondividi la tua poesia con gli altri. Discutete la poesia, il suo significato. \nIn che modo il cielo stellato e le sorgenti astronomiche ti hanno influenzato? Qual \u00e8 l'oggetto della poesia? Che relazione ha con l'astronomia.\n\n###Step 8:\nEcco un paio di esempi di poesie. Cercatene in rete, ce ne sono tantissime da scegliere anche insieme agli studenti. \n\n**Stelle senza nome**\n\nI nomi delle stelle sono belli:  \nSirio, Andromeda, l'Orsa, i due Gemelli.  \nChi mai potrebbe dirli tutti in fila?  \nSon pi\u00f9 di cento volte centomila.  \nE in fondo al cielo, non so dove e come,  \nc'\u00e8 un milione di stelle senza nome:  \nstelle comuni, nessuno le cura,  \nma per loro la notte \u00e8 meno scura.  \n\nGianni Rodari, \n\n**Quando udii il dotto astronomo**\n\nQuando udii il dotto astronomo,  \nquando le prove e le cifre mi vennero incolonnate dinanzi,  \nquando mi mostrarono le carte e i diagrammi, da addizionare, dividere,  \ncalcolare,  \nquando seduto nell'anfiteatro udii l'astronomo parlare, e venir a lungo applaudito,  \ncome improvvisamente, inesplicabilmente mi sentii stanco, disgustato,   \nfinch\u00e9, alzatomi, fuori scivolando me ne uscii tutto solo,  \nnella mistica umida aria notturna e, di tratto in tratto,  \nalzavo gli occhi a contemplare in silenzio le stelle.  \n\nWalt Whitman, 1865 http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174747 \n\nAlcuni esempi di \"astropoesia\" (in inglese) si trovano sul giornale online Astropoetica:\nhttp://astropoetica.com/ \ne sul blog di  Astronomers Without Borders: http://astronomerswithoutborders.org/awb-programs/arts-and-culture/astropoetry.html. \n\nNota: L'attivit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 essere svolta anche all'interno, mostrando immagini astronomiche agli studenti e chiedendo loro di scrivere una poesia in base a quanto visto.", "curriculum": "Paese | Classe | Materia | Certificazione | \n--- | --- | --- | ---\nI | primarie | Scienze | - | Astronomia, Terra\nI | primarie | Italiano | - | Composizione\nI | secondarie I grado | Scienze | - | Astronomia, Terra\nI | secondarie I grado | Italiano | - | Poesia\n", "additional_information": "- L'attivit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 essere svolta anche all'interno, mostrando immagini astronomiche agli studenti: http://twanight.org/\n\n- Alcune poesie di Gianni Rodari dedicate all'astronomia: http://lisaciccone.blogspot.it/2013/08/i-cieli-di-rodari-astronomia-in.html\n\n- Le filastrocche di Martina Tremenda sul sito http://edu.inaf.it (in costruzione)", "conclusion": "Attraverso il processo creativo stimolato da questa attivit\u00e0, gli studenti imparano ad approfondire alcuni temi astronomici, ad apprezzare il cielo stellato e ad averne maggiore consapevolezza.\n\nAttraverso il processo di cooperazione e di spiegazione dei concetti astronomici, raffinano le loro competenze grammaticali e di comunicazione.

I pianeti orbitano attorno al Sole e sono diversi sia in dimensioni che in composizione.  \nIl Sistema Solare si trova nella galassia detta Via Lattea, insieme ad un gran numero di altre stelle.     \n  Le grandi distanze tra le stelle sono quasi inimmaginabili cos\u00ec come la posizione del Sistema Solare nell\u2019Universo. Al confronto di queste distanza, quelle tra i pianeti del Sistema Solare sono molto piccole, ma a paragone delle distanze sulla Terra,  diventa difficile visualizzarle. La distanza tra Plutone e il Sole \u00e8 circa 5.9 miliardi di kilometri!\n\nIl Sole e i pianeti del Sistema Solare (gli insegnanti sono incoraggiati a condividere queste informazioni durante l\u2019attivit\u00e0)\n\n* Il Sole \u00e8 la stella pi\u00f9 vicina alla Terra; \u00e8 formata da particelle elettricamente cariche, soprattutto di idrogeno ed elio. Potrebbe contenere pi\u00f9 di un milione di Terre. E\u2019 una stella di medie dimensioni alimentata da fusione nucleare. La luce del Sole impiega circa 8 minuti per raggiungere la Terra dopo che \u00e8 stata emessa dalla sua superficie.\n\n* Mercurio \u00e8 il pianeta pi\u00f9 vicino al Sole, e anche il pi\u00f9 piccolo in dimensioni. Poich\u00e9 non ha un\u2019atmosfera, vi si alternano temperature estreme sia calde che fredde. Tra tutti i pineti del Sistema Solare, Mercurio \u00e8 quello pi\u00f9 denso.\n\n* Venere \u00e8 il pianeta pi\u00f9 caldo del Sistema Solare ed ha dimensioni molto simili alla Terra. Il pianeta ha un\u2019atmosfera molto densa composta soprattutto da anidride carbonica che gli fa raggiungere la temperatura pi\u00f9 alta tra tutti i pianeti (740 Kelvin, mentre la Terra \u00e8 circa 290 Kelvin). Venere \u00e8 quasi del tutto ricoperto da uno spesso strato di nubi di acido solforico che impedisce ai raggi solari di raggiungere l\u2019atmosfera.\n\n* La Terra \u00e8 il solo pianeta conosciuto fino ad ora che ospita la vita. Ha un campo magnetico che si estende per migliaia di km nello spazio e che protegge il pianeta dalle radiazioni solari dannose. Il pianeta si trova al centro di quella che gli astronomi chiamano zona di abitabilit\u00e0, in cui le temperature sono adatte all\u2019esistenza di acqua in forma liquida.\n\n* Un gran numero di satelliti di passaggio, lander satelliti orbitanti, e rover sono stati mandati su Marte per studiarlo. Una delle questioni pi\u00f9 grandi sul pianeta \u00e8: \u00e8 mai esistita acqua su Marte? Ora si sa che su Marte c\u2019\u00e8 acqua ghiacciata sulle cappe polari.\n\n* Giove \u00e8 il pianeta pi\u00f9 grande del Sistema Solare, ed \u00e8 il primo tra i pianeti gassosi. Contiene pi\u00f9 di due volte la massa  di tutti gli altri pianeti del Sistema Solare messi insieme ed \u00e8 cos\u00ec grande che potrebbe contenere 1400 Terre.\n\n* Saturno \u00e8 conosciutissimo per i suoi brillanti anelli. Impiega circa 30 anni terrestri per ruotare attorno al Sole, ma solo 11 ore per ruotare attorno al proprio asse. I suoi anelli sono composti da miliardi di frammenti di roccia e ghiaccio.\n\n* Urano \u00e8 noto come il gigante ghiacciato, poich\u00e9 \u00e8 composto da quantit\u00e0 relativamente grandi di metano e acqua gelati. Il suo asse di rotazione \u00e8 quasi parallelo al piano dell\u2019orbita, mentre gli altri pianeti girano pi\u00f9 o meno perpendicolarmente al piano del Sistema Solare.\n\n* Nettuno \u00e8 il pianeta pi\u00f9 lontano del Sistema Solare. La sua distanza da Urano \u00e8 circa la met\u00e0 della distanza di Urano dal Sole. Come Urano, Nettuno ha anelli sottili che quindi appaiono molto deboli. \n\nAltri corpi\n* La Luna \u00e8 l\u2019unico satellite naturale della Terra e fu visitato dall\u2019uomo per la prima volta dalla missione Apollo 11 nel 1969. Le aree lunari scure e relativamente lisce che si vedono chiaramente a occhio nudo si chiamano mari e sono il risultato di antica lava basaltica.\n* La fascia degli asteroidi \u00e8 una regione che si trova tra le orbite di Marte e Giove ed \u00e8 popolata da asteroidi di diverse forme e dimensioni. Gli asteroidi sono oggetti rocciosi e/o metallici e sono chiamati anche pianetoidi o pianeti minori perch\u00e9 sono molto piccoli (le loro dimensioni vanno da quello di un sasso a circa 1000 km).\n* Le comete sono oggetti ghiacciati che hanno una grande variet\u00e0 di periodi orbitali. Quando passano vicino al Sole si riscaldano ed emettono materiale gassoso prendendo la forma di una palla con la coda.\n* Plutone \u00e8 un pianeta nano. Dalla sua scoperta nel 1930 Plutone \u00e8 stato considerato un pianeta, fino a quando la scoperta del pi\u00f9 grande Eris ha messo in discussione questa classificazione. Nel 2006 la definizione di pianeta ufficializzata dall\u2019International Astronomical Union ha escluso Plutone perch\u00e9 non ha liberato la sua orbita dagli oggetti vicini.\n\nL\u2019Unit\u00e0 Astronomica (AU):  \n\u00e8 un\u2019unit\u00e0 di lunghezza, e vale approssimativamente quanto la distanza Terra-Sole. Gli astronomi la usano per descrivere le grandi distanze proprie del Sistema Solare.\n\nIl fattore di scala.  \nIn un modello in scala tutte le distanze e le dimensioni sono ridotte o aumentate da un fattore di scala. Questo si definisce come: fattore di scala=valore vero/valore di riferimento.\nAd esempio, quando mettiamo in scala il Sistema Solare, usiamo come valore vero il diametro della Terra come  misura di riferimento, in questo, caso un seme di pomodoro di 2mm. Per mettere in scala gli altri pianeti, useremo le loro misure vere e il fattore di scala calcolato sopra:   \n\nmodello in scala=valore vero/fattore di scala.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/ba24077f-cf37-4f13-86d8-a0c07e0e7b46/astroedu1512-map.jpg)\nFigura: Esempio di modello in scala del Sistema Solare su una piantina di Monaco, che mostra le orbite di Mercurio, Venere, Terra, Marte, Giove, Saturno, Urano e Nettuno attorno al Sole (che si trova nel centro della citt\u00e0, a Marienplatz)", "fulldesc": "L\u2019attivit\u00e0 consiste nel portare gli studenti a costruire un modello in scala ridotta del Sistema Solare. E\u2019 molto difficile visualizzare gli enormi spazi vuoti che esistono tra i pianeti e il Sole e comprendere quanto grande o piccolo \u00e8 ciascuno di essi relativamente agli altri. I passaggi che seguono possono aiutare nella realizzazione del modello in scala.\n\n###Step 1:\nSi coinvolgano gli studenti in una discussione sul Sistema solare.\n\n- Si chieda agli studenti dove si trova il Sole all\u2019interno della Via Lattea (ad esempio mostrando loro un\u2019immagine della galassia)\n- Qual \u00e8 la stella pi\u00f9 vicina alla Terra?\n- Quanto \u00e8 vicina la successiva? E il pianeta pi\u00f9 vicino?\n- Quali altri oggetti si trovano nel Sistema Solare?\n- Quanto sono grandi uno rispetto all\u2019altro gli oggetti del Sistema Solare? Ci sono altre differenze tra di loro? Quali sono le due categorie principali in cui si dividono i pianeti?\n- Come si potrebbero rappresentare queste quantit\u00e0 sulla Terra? Si chieda agli studenti se hanno qualche suggerimento su come rappresentare queste distanze e dimensioni su scala ridotta.\n\nSi chieda agli studenti di descrivere le caratteristiche di un modello in scala, si scrivano le risposte su una lavagna e si discutano fino ad avere le risposte corrette. La lista dovrebbe contenere tutte le dimensioni lineari (lunghezze, altezze, ampiezze). Questa discussione pu\u00f2 portare gli studenti a comprendere la difficolt\u00e0 nel realizzare i grandi valori numerici in gioco nel Sistema Solare e spingerli a pensare, almeno intuitivamente ad un modello in scala.\n\n###Step 2\n\nSi chieda agli studenti di fare previsioni sul modello.\n\n- Si dividano gli studenti in gruppi.\n- Si chieda agli studenti quali parametri sono necessari per riportare in scala il Sistema Solare.\n- Si chieda agli studenti di fare delle previsioni qualitative sul modello in scala immaginando di posizionarlo sulla mappa (tenendo conto delle distanze mostrate sulla mappa) e di creare o identificare una misura per ciascun corpo del Sistema Solare.\n- Cosa si potrebbe fare per avere una rappresentazione pi\u00f9 accurata?\n- Si discuta sul modello previsto e su eventuali errori trovati.\n\nAlla fine di questa fase gli studenti dovrebbero essere in grado di capire che sia le distanze che le dimensioni sono necessarie per costruire un modello in scala.\n\n###Step 3\nGli studenti costruiscono il modello sulla base dei loro calcoli.\n\n- Si fornisca un foglio di calcolo che contiene le distanze tra i corpi del Sistema solare e le loro dimensioni a ciascun gruppo di studenti.\n- Si invitino gli studenti a discutere tra loro come questi dati possono essere combinati per costruire il modello\n- Si diano esempi di riduzione in scala su oggetti di uso in classe, usando calcoli semplici (ad esempio riscalando una penna alla met\u00e0 della sua lunghezza o dimezzando la distanza tra due studenti) per mostrare come si usa un fattore di scala.\n- Si fornisca a ciascun gruppo un seme di pomodoro (o un qualsiasi oggetto rotondo del diametro di 2 mm) da usare come rappresentazione della Terra.\n- Si faccia determinare agli studenti quali calcoli sono necessari per costruire il modello in scala. Qual \u00e8 la nuova misura di Venere se la Terra \u00e8 riscalata a 2 mm? Come possiamo usare questa informazione per riscalare anche le distanze tra i pianeti e il Sole?\n- Si faccia completare agli studenti il foglio di calcolo. Gli studenti dovranno inoltre rappresentare in scala le dimensioni degli altri pianeti usando oggetti comuni o creando dei modellini in pasta per modellare o foglio di alluminio sulla base dei loro calcoli.\n- Gli studenti paragonino le distanze e dimensioni relative tra i diversi pianeti nelle loro previsioni di modello con quelle calcolate per il modello reale (in modo da comprendere che in un\u2019indagine scientifica non si conosce subito la risposta giusta).\n- Se si vuole, si dia la definizione di unit\u00e0 astronomica e si spieghi la ragione del suo uso da parte degli astronomi. Si scrivano le distanze tra il sole e alcuni pianeti e si chieda agli studenti di convertirle in km.\n\n###Step 4\nGli studenti costruiscono il modello in scala e lo estendono ad altri scenari.\n\n- Gli studenti posizionino i pianeti e il Sole sulla mappa. Si pu\u00f2 usare una mappa con l\u2019indicazione delle distanze reali e un righello per posizionare i pianeti.\n- Se possibile, si chieda agli studenti di cercare la posizione reale di ciascun pianeta rispetto agli altri. Questa informazione si pu\u00f2 ottenere, ad esempio, dal sito http://www.theplanetstoday.com. Si pu\u00f2 usare un compasso per tracciare le orbite\n- Si discutano i risultati con gli studenti e si chiedano o si forniscano informazioni specifiche sul Sole e sugli altri pianeti.\n- Si chieda agli studenti quali caratteristiche dei pianeti non sono considerate nel modello e come cambierebbe questo se si riducessero in scala solo le distanze. Quali fattori possono contribuire all\u2019inaccuratezza del modello? Come lo potremmo correggere?\n- Si invitino gli studenti a pensare ad altri tipo di modelli in scala (ad esempio usati in altre discipline) e come si potrebbe applicare la stessa procedura per costruirli.\n\n###Step 5\nOrganizzare una passeggiata con gli studenti alle diverse posizioni degli oggetti del Sistema Solare identificate sulla mappa.\n\n- Si motivino gli studenti ad intraprendere un viaggio attraverso il Sistema Solare\n- Prima di cominciare la passeggiata, preparare il Sole e gli altri pianeti per portarli con s\u00e9\n- Assicurarsi che la maggior parte degli studenti abbiano familiarit\u00e0 con i luoghi identificati sulla mappa.\n- Gli studenti possono essere divisi in gruppi, ognuno rappresentante un pianeta e restare nel luogo appropriato mentre gli altri studenti raggiungono il successivo. Questo passaggio dipende dal tipo di citt\u00e0 in cui si svolge l\u2019attivit\u00e0 ed \u00e8 pi\u00f9 adatto ad una strada lunga e dritta.\n- Raggiungendo le diverse posizioni, si chiedano agli studenti le caratteristiche dei diversi pianeti. Si leghi il periodo orbitale alla loro distanza dal Sole (pi\u00f9 sono lontani, pi\u00f9 lungo \u00e8 il periodo orbitale)", "curriculum": "Paese | Classe | Materia | Certificazione | Argomento\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nI | secondaria I grado| Matematica | | Rapporti, proporzioni, fattore di scala\nI | secondaria secondo grado | Matematica | | Rapporti, proporzioni, fattore di scala\nI | secondaria secondo grado | Fisica | | Misura ed errori\nI | secondaria secondo grado | Fisica | | Orbite\nI | secondaria secondo grado | Scienze | | Sistema solare", "additional_information": "\nGrounded solar system in Zagreb http://astrogeo.geoinfo.geof.hr/prizsunce/eng-home.html\n\nTo Scale, The Solar System https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR3Igc3Rhfg\n", "conclusion": "Questa attivit\u00e0 dovrebbe aiutare gli studenti a comprendere le grandi distanze tra gli oggetti del Sistema Solare e le loro dimensioni relative. \n\nDovrebbe dare un\u2019idea chiara di come si costruisce un modello in scala e della sua importanza se si vuole visualizzare il Sistema Solare in una citt\u00e0. \n\nGli studenti sono portati a riflettere su come cambia il modello se una sola caratteristica dei corpi celesti \u00e8 presa in considerazione nei calcoli.\n", "alert_message": "", "short_desc_material": "", "further_reading": "0", "reference": "", "big_idea": "", "spaceawe_authorship": ""}}, {"model": "activities.activitytranslation", "pk": 71, "fields": {"language_code": "it", "master": 13, "slug": "il-paesaggio-lunare", "title": "Il paesaggio lunare", "teaser": "Come creare crateri ed esplorare il paesaggio lunare", "theme": "Luna", "keywords": "Luna, crateri, paesaggio lunare, sistema solare, superficie", "acknowledgement": "Traduzione e adattamento di Annalisa Deliperi, INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Torino e Stefania Varano, INAF-IRA Bologna", "description": "In questa attivit\u00e0 della durata di 30-45 minuti, i bambini (in squadre di 4-5) possono sperimentare come creare crateri e conoscere il paesaggio della Luna.

In realt\u00e0, si tratta di valli scure che sembrano mari ma non lo sono: non esiste acqua allo stato liquido sulla superficie lunare, solo un po' di ghiaccio nei crateri pi\u00f9 profondi.

Hanno ognuno diverse dimensioni e alcuni di loro mostrano raggi \u201cluminosi\u201d e chiari tutto intorno, il che indica che sono relativamente giovani (i crateri scuri sono pi\u00f9 vecchi). Sulla Terra, gli impatti di meteoriti scompaiono nel tempo a causa dell'erosione: pioggia, vento e acqua levigano le superfici portando via irregolarit\u00e0 fino a quando solo quelli pi\u00f9 recenti rimangono ancora visibili. Inoltre, l'atmosfera della Terra brucia la maggior parte dei meteoriti prima che si infrangano sulla sua superficie. La Luna per\u00f2, non ha atmosfera, il che significa che tutti i crateri rimangono intatti. Questo \u00e8 il motivo per cui la Luna \u00e8 segnata da tanti crateri, che continuano ad aumentare col passare del tempo!\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/a2090d87-e57a-46b7-85ec-d60f4428a647/1311_lunar_features.jpg)\nSi ringraziano Gregory H.Revera / graphic: C.

Tutto quel che ha una massa \u00e8 soggetto alla gravit\u00e0. \nQuel che causa la forza di gravit\u00e0, in effetti, non \u00e8 noto. La forza di gravit\u00e0 della Terra (cio\u00e8 il \u2018peso\u2019 di un corpo) \u00e8 la forza che tiene legati al pianeta gli alberi, l\u2019acqua, gli animali, gli edifici e l\u2019aria che respiriamo. \nAnche sugli altri pianeti, sulle stelle e sulle lune dell\u2019universo potremmo sperimentare una forza di tipo gravitazionale. Persino i nostri stessi corpi esercitano un\u2019attrazione gravitazionale su quel che li circonda. Naturalmente la forza di gravit\u00e0 della Terra \u00e8 enormemente pi\u00f9 intensa di quella esercitata dai nostri corpi, tanto che quella dei nostri stessi corpi \u00e8 del tutto trascurabile.  \n\nL\u2019intensit\u00e0 della forza di gravit\u00e0 dipende dalla massa e dalla vicinanza dei corpi fra i quali si valuta. La Terra e la Luna si attraggono in modo pi\u00f9 intenso di quanto non accada fra Terra e Giove, perch\u00e9 Terra e Luna sono molto pi\u00f9 vicini. \n\nLa Terra ha un\u2019attrazione gravitazionale maggiore di quella della Luna, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 pi\u00f9 \u00e8 massiva. Dunque il peso sulla Terra \u00e8 maggiore di quello che gli astronauti esperimentano sulla Luna. Questa \u00e8 la ragione per la quale gli astronauti possono saltare pi\u00f9 in alto sul nostro satellite naturale piuttosto che sulla Luna. \nIn effetti, nel quotidiano non ci accorgiamo della forza di gravit\u00e0, ma solo delle sue conseguenze quando proviamo a saltare o quando cadiamo. E pare che lo scienziato, Isaac Newton, che per primo ha descritto la \u2018Legge della gravitazione universale\u2019 sia stato ispirato da una mela che \u00e8 gli caduta in testa mentre sedeva sotto un albero a meditare. Be\u2019, la mela era stata fatta cadere dalla gravit\u00e0!\n\n####Buchi neri\n\nUn buco nero \u00e8 una regione dello spazio nella quale la gravit\u00e0 \u00e8 cos\u00ec intensa che niente di quel che vi entra potr\u00e0 poi sfuggirne. Neanche la luce. \nI buchi neri si formano quanto una stella di elevata massa termina il suo carburante termonucleare e non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 in grado di tenere in equilibrio gli strati di gas che la costituiscono. \nSe la stella \u00e8 abbastanza massiva \u2013 circa 25 volte il Sole \u2013 la gravit\u00e0 comprime il gas verso il suo interno: si dice che la stella \u2018collassa\u2019, divenendo sempre pi\u00f9 piccola fino a quando la sua densit\u00e0 assume dei valori tanto elevati da tendere all\u2019infinito, mentre le sue dimensioni si riducono a zero. Queste condizioni descrivono uno stato fisico detto \u2018singolarit\u00e0\u2019, che \u2013 dal punto di vista matematico si ottiene da un procedimento \u2018al limite\u2019.\n\nDopo la sua formazione, il buco nero pu\u00f2 continuare a crescere inglobando massa dalle sue vicinanze: da altre stelle e da altri buchi neri, per esempio.  Se un buco nero assorbe abbastanza materiale, aumentando di massa fino a raggiungere un milione di masse solari, diventa un \u2018buco nero supermassivo\u2019. Si ritiene che i buchi neri supermassivi risiedano nei centri della maggior parte delle galassie, inclusa la Via Lattea.\n\nUn buco nero \u00e8 costituito da tre parti: la singolarit\u00e0 (cio\u00e8 la stella \u2018collassata\u2019), l\u2019orizzonte degli eventi interno (cio\u00e8 la regione intorno alla singolarit\u00e0 da cui niente, neppure la luce, pu\u00f2 uscire), e l\u2019orizzonte degli eventi esterno (dove i corpi sentono la gravit\u00e0 del buco nero ma non ne sono intrappolati).\n\nUn buco nero \u00e8 costituito da tre parti: la singolarit\u00e0 (cio\u00e8 la stella \u2018collassata\u2019), l\u2019orizzonte degli eventi interno (cio\u00e8 la regione intorno alla singolarit\u00e0 da cui niente, neppure la luce, pu\u00f2 uscire), e l\u2019orizzonte degli eventi esterno (dove i corpi sentono la gravit\u00e0 del buco nero ma non ne sono intrappolati).\n\nGli astronomi di solito osservano le sorgenti celesti raccogliendo la luce (emessa o riflessa). Tuttavia, visto che i buchi neri non ne emettono, non possono essere osservate in maniera standard. Gli astronomi devono osservare con attenzione l\u2019interazione fra un buco nero ed altri corpi. Per esempio, man mano che i buchi neri attraggono e inghiottono la materia circostante, si forma un disco di accrescimento, in modo simile al disco di acqua che si forma intorno a un gorgo.\n\nDato che il disco ruota sempre pi\u00f9 veloce, si scalda fino a raggiungere temperature altissime e causando l\u2019emissione di enormi getti di gas e luce nello spazio. Se queste strutture \u2018a disco\u2019 puntano verso la Terra, questi getti risultano cos\u00ec brillanti da essere rivelati dai telescopi.\n\nI buchi neri che non hanno disco, invece, possono essere rilevati osservando il movimento delle stelle intorno a loro, dato che le loro orbite risultano alterate rispetto a quel che ci aspettiamo.\n\n####Spazio-tempo\nLo spazio ha tre dimensioni (su-gi\u00f9, destra-sinistra e avanti-dietro). Se aggiungi una quarta dimensione, il tempo, ottieni quel che viene chiamato \u2018continuo spazio-temporale\u2019 o, pi\u00f9 semplicemente, \u2018spazio-tempo\u2019. \u00c8 vero, pu\u00f2 suonare strano, ma immagina di dover incontrare qualcuno. Hai bisogno di sapere dove (coordinate spaziali) ma anche di sapere quando! Da questo punto di vista, la nostra realt\u00e0 ha quattro dimensioni: spazio e tempo.\n\nAlbert Einstein \u00e8 stato il primo a proporre l\u2019idea del \u2018tessuto spaziale\u2019 (spazio-tempo) nella sua Teoria della Relativit\u00e0 Generale. Prima delle teorie di Eistein, si riteneva che la gravit\u00e0 fosse una forza \u2013 proprio come spiegato tanti anni prima da Newton. La Relativit\u00e0 Generale cambia la prospettiva, spiegando la gravit\u00e0 in termini di \u2018curvatura dello spazio-tempo\u2019. Questo concetto pu\u00f2 essere visualizzato immaginando lo spazio-tempo costituito da un materiale elastico. Le sfere disposte sul materiale elastico lo deformano, in un modo sostanzialmente simile a quello che descrive la deformazione dello spazio-tempo da parte della materia.", "fulldesc": "Nell\u2019attivit\u00e0 che segue, gli studenti costruiranno un semplice modello di buco nero, che possa facilitare loro la visualizzazione di come nella realt\u00e0 un corpo del genere possa \u2018distorcere\u2019 lo spazio e il tempo e influenzare il comportamento degli oggetti nelle sue vicinanze.\nL\u2019attivit\u00e0 dovrebbe prendere circa un\u2019ora di tempo.\n\n###Step 1\nPrima di iniziare, usa le informazioni del paragrafo precedente per introdurre l\u2019argomento ai bambini, in particolare il concetto di \u2018gravit\u00e0\u2019. Puoi farlo raccontando la storia di Isaac Newton e dell\u2019albero di mele o facendo saltare tutti i bambini, facendo prendere loro coscienza che \u00e8 proprio la gravit\u00e0 a riportarli a terra.\n\n###Step 2\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image2.jpg)\n\nTaglia un quadrato di benda elastica 40 cm x 40 cm. Se fosse tubolare, naturalmente, dovrai tagliarne un lato per renderlo piano.\n\n###Step 3\nChiedi a diversi studenti di allungare la benda elastica in senso orizzontale, fino a quanto non sia cos\u00ec ben tesa da poter essere considerate uno \u2018spazio\u2019 bidimensionale piatto. Nota che gli studenti devono tenere ben ferma la benda, perch\u00e9 il loro movimento non deve influenzare l\u2019esperimento.\n\n###Step 4\nMetti la biglia sulla benda e falla rotolare sulla superficie. La traiettoria della biglia dovrebbe seguire una linea dritta, simile a quella di un fascio di luce che viaggia nello spazio vuoto.\n\n###Step 5\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image3.jpg)\n\nSostituisci la biglia con la palla pesante. Quanto l\u2019appoggi sulla benda elastica, noterai che il tessuto si deforma: lo \u2018spazio\u2019 si curva intorno al corpo pesante.\n\n###Step 6\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image4.jpg)\n\nFai rotolare la biglia vicino alla sfera pensante. La sua traiettoria, ora, non sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 dritta ma risulter\u00e0 alterata a causa della deformazione della benda elastica, cio\u00e8 del tessuto dello spazio.\nQuesto \u00e8 simile a quel che accade alla luce che passa vicino a un corpo molto massivo che deforma lo spazio che lo circonda. Prova a variare la velocit\u00e0 della biglia per vedere come cambia la sua traiettoria.\n\n###Step 7:\n![](/media/activities/attach/6c956b8b-dc05-4cac-a470-f1c78734ec1c/astroEDU1304_image5.jpg)\n\nPi\u00f9 \u00e8 concentrata la massa centrale (cio\u00e8 pi\u00f9 \u00e8 pesante la sfera), pi\u00f9 la benda si curver\u00e0. Questo aumenta la profondit\u00e0 del \u2018pozzo gravitazionale\u2019 dal quale la biglia \u2013 alla fine \u2013 non sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 in grado di liberarsi.\n\n###Step 8:\nQuando la biglia passa vicino alla sfera pesante, inizia a orbitare intorno al \u2018buco nero\u2019 e alla fine ci cade dentro. Vedi? Ecco come le cose possono facilmente cadere in un buco nero ma non possono uscirne! E questo \u00e8 proprio quel che accade con i buchi neri: la loro forza di gravit\u00e0 deforma lo spazio in modo tale che la luce e qualunque altro oggetto che vi cada non possa sfuggirne.

Su Marte, gli scienziati stanno cercando posti dove la vita potrebbe essersi sviluppata in passato o dove potrebbe essere sopravvissuta all\u2019interno di rifugi geologici (all\u2019interno di grotte, nel sottosuolo, all'interno di rocce, in strati contenenti acqua, ecc..). Questo \u00e8 il motivo per cui la NASA era alla ricerca di segni della presenza di acqua. Ora che antichi laghi e unit\u00e0 geologiche contenenti acqua (sottoforma di ghiaccio) sono stati identificati, stanno cercando segni di vita passata o presente. Europa pu\u00f2 avere un oceano nel sottosuolo che, attraverso alcune fratture, \u00e8 esposto allo spazio. Lo scienziato al giorno d\u2019oggi sta cercando forme di vita che si basano sugli stessi elementi su cui si fonda la vita terrestre, ad esempio sul carbonio che a sua volta si fonda sull\u2019acqua, e quindi cercano posti in cui l\u2019acqua pu\u00f2 esistere allo stato liquido. Potrebbero esistere anche altre forme di vita diverse, ma dato che non sappiamo nulla su di esse o su come identificarle, l\u2019obiettivo principale \u00e8 la ricerca di vita basata sul carbonio di pi\u00f9 facile identificazione.\n \n**Riguardo i programmi spaziali**: In aggiunta alla ricerca di forme di vita o corpi e regioni abitabili per la vita terrestre, i programmi spaziali sono anche motivati dalla competizione fra i vari stati. L\u2019esplorazione spaziale ci aiuta anche a capire i processi geologici sul nostro pianeta e il passato e il futuro della Terra. Ad esempio, l\u2019intenso effetto serra presente su Venere pu\u00f2 aiutarci a predire processi simili che nel futuro potrebbero verificarsi sulla Terra oppure i crateri d\u2019impatto rivelano l\u2019aspetto della Terra di 4 miliardi di anni fa. Uno tra i risultati pi\u00f9 inaspettati del programma Apollo, che ha spedito uomini sulla Luna, \u00e8 stato il cos\u00ec detto \u201cEffetto della veduta d\u2019insieme\u201d: questo \u00e8 stato il primo \u2013e finora l\u2019ultimo- momento in cui gli occhi umani hanno visto il nostro pianeta come un fragile \u201cmarmo blu\u201d contro lo spazio nero e vuoto e questo ha cambiato la percezione che abbiamo del nostro mondo e del nostro posto nell\u2019universo.\n \n**Riguardo la ricerca spaziale**: i singoli scienziati possono fare ricerca su una singola geo-morfologia per anni, tentando di spiegare come e quando si \u00e8 formata. Altri mappano specifiche regioni nel dettaglio e classificano le caratteristiche visualizzate sulla mappa. Dopo che uno scienziato pubblica i risultati della ricerca, essa diviene un piccolo mattone nel grande edificio della scienza planetaria e gli altri scienziati possono usare questo risultato per migliorare i propri modelli di evoluzione della superficie o possono usare questi risultati nella propria ricerca. La maggior parte dei contenuti mostrati su queste mappe sono stati ottenuti nell\u2019ultima decade, in alcuni casi, solamente negli ultimi anni. L\u2019origine di alcune morfologie non \u00e8 stata ancora pienamente compresa.\n \n###Descrizioni generali dei parametri che potrebbero essere discussi quando si descrive il pianeta o la luna prescelta.\n**Le tipologie di corpi celesti**: Pianeta o luna. I pianeti orbitano attorno al Sole, le lune orbitano attorno ad un pianeta. Una faccia della luna generalmente guarda sempre il suo pianeta (rotazione sincrona).\n**La composizione dei corpi**: I corpi rocciosi sono composti di rocce silicee (\u00e8 il caso della Terra). I corpi ghiacciati sono composti da un misto di roccia e acqua (H_2O) in forma solida (ghiaccio) ma solitamente la loro superficie \u00e8 composta prevalentemente da ghiaccio (ad esempio Europa). Su questi mondi le montagne e le pianure sono composte da roccia- ghiaccio duro. I corpi ghiacciati si trovano esclusivamente nella parte pi\u00f9 fredda del sistema solare esterno.\n**Atmosfera**: Troviamo atmosfere esclusivamente se la gravit\u00e0 (e la dimensione) dei corpi \u00e8 sufficiente a trattenere le molecole di gas. E\u2019 pi\u00f9 facile trattenere una molecola di gas se questa \u00e8 fredda. \n**Liquido**: I liquidi possono essere acqua nel sistema solare interno o metano-etano-azoto in quello esterno. Si trovano liquidi solo dove c\u2019\u00e8 un\u2019atmosfera che produce pressione derivante dall\u2019aria. Se la pressione \u00e8 troppo bassa, le molecole liquide evaporano/sublimano. Se invece \u00e8 la temperatura ad essere troppo bassa, i liquidi si congelano. Se la temperatura \u00e8 troppo alta, i liquidi evaporano. L\u2019acqua pu\u00f2 comunque esistere nel sottosuolo.\n**Meteorologia**: Escursione termica (il cambiamento di temperatura tra giorno e notte) e la formazione di precipitazioni.\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: Le caratteristiche prodotte da forze interne del pianeta. L\u2019**attivit\u00e0 vulcanica** richiede che l\u2019interno del corpo sia fuso. Il calore \u00e8 generato a partire dalla formazione planetaria (impatto/accrescimento del calore) o dal decadimento irreversibile degli elementi radioattivi. Corpi piccoli si freddano pi\u00f9 velocemente dei corpi grandi, quindi fenomeni vulcanici si trovano solo sui pianeti pi\u00f9 grandi. Eccezion fatta per i casi in cui l\u2019interno \u00e8 continuamente riscaldato: questo accade all\u2019interno delle lune che ruotano su orbite ellittiche dove le forze di marea producono calore interno (ad esempio Io). Le **caratteristiche tettoniche** sono causate da tensioni generate nella parte fragile della crosta. Tali forze producono fratture durante i terremoti. Ci\u00f2 richiede movimenti interni al pianeta, anch\u2019essi legati al calore interno. I vulcani crescono in altezza perch\u00e9 da essi fuoriesce lava che si aggiunge agli strati sottostanti, ma, in alcuni casi, possono collassare e produrre una caldera che \u00e8 simile a un cratere.\n**Caratteristiche esogene**: Sono il prodotto dei processi che avvengono sulla superficie o processi atmosferici. Esse comprendono fenomeni eolici (legati al vento), fluviali (legati ai fiumi), lacustri (legati ai laghi), oceanici e i relativi depositi.\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: Le caratteristiche prodotte dall\u2019impatto con altri corpi (crateri pi\u00f9 piccoli e grandi bacini di impatto). I crateri pi\u00f9 recenti possiedono raggi radiali (prodotti dal materiale espulso).\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: Le caratteristiche pi\u00f9 comuni sono i crateri. La maggior parte dei crateri si sono formati poco dopo la formazione del sistema solare e ma ci sono ancora molti piccoli corpi nello spazio. I crateri sono rari sulle superfici che sono state ricoperte recentemente, perch\u00e9 il nuovo strato rimuove o seppellisce i crateri. I processi di ricopertura includono pianure vulcaniche, erosione fluviale e sedimentazione, e anche subduzione legata alla tettonica a placche.\n**Caratteristiche Rare/Speciali**: Sono le caratteristiche che non sono state trovate in molti altri posti e possono essere causate da condizioni atmosferiche/climatiche molto specifiche o i resti di un evento inusuale nel passato del corpo.\n**Parametri che limitano la vita**: La vita dovrebbe essere in grado di crescere e riprodursi. Essa pu\u00f2 essere condizionata negativamente da temperature al di sotto del punto di congelamento o al di sopra di quello di ebollizione, dalla mancanza di atmosfera, di acqua o di una magnetosfera (le magnetosfere proteggono i corpi dalle pericolose radiazioni presenti nel vento solare).\n**Nomenclatura (dare un nome)**: Il nome dei posti pu\u00f2 essere proposto dagli scienziati che ne studiano una regione o una sua caratteristica e questo deve essere approvato dal gruppo di lavoro dell\u2019Unione Astronomica Internazionale specializzato nei nomi planetari. Ogni tipo di caratteristica e ogni corpo ha un particolare tema (ad esempio, il dio del fuoco per Io) e i termini generici (come Montagna) sono in Latino per garantire la neutralit\u00e0 della lingua. Viene seguita anche la tradizione geografica del 1600 quando le prime mappe delle lune create in Europa contenevano nomi Latini.\n**Et\u00e0**: L\u2019et\u00e0 della superficie. Molti crateri in superficie indicano una superficie antica (4 miliardi di anni), meno crateri indicano una superficie pi\u00f9 giovane (0-3 miliardi di anni). Nel sistema solare pi\u00f9 antico (circa 4 miliardi di anni fa) c\u2019erano molti piccoli oggetti che avrebbero potuto impattare sui corpi causando crateri. Pi\u00f9 tardi, erano presenti molti meno oggetti poich\u00e9 avevano gi\u00e0 impattato su qualche pianeta o erano stati spazzati via dai loro campi gravitazionali.\n \n**Forme delle caratteristiche geologiche**:\n**Circolari**: di solito si tratta di un cratere d\u2019impatto, occasionalmente una caldera vulcanica;\n**Lineare (dritta)**: depressione = frattura tettonica, innalzamento = dune, increspature, montagne;\n**Serpeggiante**: canale scavato da un fiume o dalla lava;\n**Lobato**: L\u2019acqua raggiunge un cratere d\u2019impatto, espulsioni (detriti gettati da un impatto o da un vulcano), glaciazioni, frane;\n**Radiale**: Raggio legato ai crateri di impatto;\n**Concentrico**: anelli del cratere d\u2019impatto.\nConfronto con la Terra (Per la mappa della Terra usa http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html oppure usa Google Map).\n**Tipo di corpo**: pianeta;\n**Composizione del corpo**: roccioso;\n**Atmosfera**: Giusta;\n**Liquido**: Acqua;\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: vulcani, faglie. La tettonica a placche \u00e8 unica sulla terra;\n**Caratteristiche esogene**: Fiumi, laghi, dune, pianure alluvionali, delta, ghiacciai. Le caratteristiche glaciali sulla Terra non sono permanenti, la maggior parte del tempo non c\u2019\u00e8 stato ghiaccio sulla Terra;\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: pi\u00f9 di 100 crateri d\u2019impatto, molti dei quali sepolti o consumati a causa delle erosioni, distrutti dalla tettonica a placche (processo di subduzione) oppure meteoriti caduti in acqua e privi di crateri permanenti;\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: Oceani, montagne, pianure, fiumi;\n**Caratteristiche rare**: Ghiacciai;\n**Parametro limitante per la vita**: Localit\u00e0 in cui c\u2019\u00e8 siccit\u00e0 (non c\u2019\u00e8 acqua liquida \u2013 deserti) o troppo fredde (non c\u2019\u00e8 acqua liquida \u2013 Antartide);\n**Et\u00e0**: Per lo pi\u00f9 molto giovane, alcune superfici hanno un miliardo di anni.\n![Figura 1](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/758bb76a-3998-4f20-bbb3-99510b5d7287/olympus.jpg)\nConfronto tra la pi\u00f9 alta montagna sulla terra e il monte Olimpo che si trova su Marte", "fulldesc": "L\u2019insegnante dovrebbe avere la mappa di Io o stampata a dimensioni tali da essere fisicamente leggibile e accessibile per gli studenti o proiettata a piena risoluzione su uno schermo.\nA partire da questa fase puoi scegliere uno o pi\u00f9 dei sotto-argomenti che seguono progettati per attivit\u00e0 strutturate che possono essere svolte con o senza dispense oppure si possono seguire le stesse dispense. Le istruzioni per le attivit\u00e0 sono mostrate anche sulla dispensa.\nLeggi la pagina 1 delle dispense con gli studenti, chiedendogli di sottolineare tutte le parole che non capiscono cos\u00ec che tu gliele possa spiegare.\n###CARTOGRAFIA\nFa vedere la mappa alla classe e chiedi agli studenti perch\u00e9 secondo loro la rappresentazione del corpo \u00e8 circolare (ad esempio il pianeta \u00e8 un corpo sferico). Dopodich\u00e9 chiedi loro perch\u00e9 ci sono due cerchi (emisferi)-mappe differenti mostrate in figura. Spiega che una sfera viene rappresentata attraverso due illustrazioni di forma circolare, e quelle che vedono sono due parti di una sfera singola. Chiameremo uno emisfero ovest (quello di sinistra) e l\u2019altro emisfero est.\n**Attivit\u00e0 1**:\n- Disegna l\u2019Equatore (una linea orizzontale a met\u00e0 fra i due cerchi);\n- Segna i poli (in entrambe gli emisferi);\n- Scrivi il nome del corpo come titolo della mappa.\nConfronta la rappresentazione cartografica con la fotografia reale (guarda la figura 1 sulla dispensa). Chiedi quali sono le differenze fra le due figure. E\u2019 stata usata una generalizzazione cartografica (semplificativa) ed \u00e8 stata posta particolare enfasi sulle caratteristiche importanti e rilevanti, ma non necessariamente visibili. Per pianeti con un\u2019atmosfera opaca, la superficie non \u00e8 visibile in foto. Anche i colori della mappa possono essere differenti dai colori reali. Quali elementi che non sono in foto sono invece presenti sulla mappa? Perch\u00e9 questi elementi sono necessari? (Nota Bene: Le creature aliene non sono reali).\n###GEOLOGIA\nChiedi alla classe quale informazione geologica (che riguarda la morfologia) possono visualizzare sulla mappa. Nomina almeno una caratteristica di questo tipo (Guarda l\u2019attivit\u00e0 2 sulle dispense per trovarne una lista).\nIdentifica/trova morfologie endogene che sono prodotte da magma proveniente dagli strati sottostanti la superficie (morfologie vulcaniche: vulcani, flussi di lava; morfologie tettoniche: crepe, fratture). Identifica/trova morfologie esogene, ovvero prodotte da processi in atto sulla superficie di un pianeta che possiede un\u2019atmosfera (vento: dune, deserti; acqua: condizioni metereologiche, fiumi, oceani, laghi, sedimentazioni). Identifica/trova morfologie cosmogeniche che sono prodotte dai processi derivanti da un impatto (crateri o bacini d\u2019impatto prodotti da asteroidi o comete provenenti dallo spazio).\n**Attivit\u00e0 2**: mappa grafica. Usando la mappa, disegna uno schizzo generalizzato (semplificato) di una mappa, delineando i contorni caratteristiche pi\u00f9 importanti (disegna diversi tipi di caratteristiche, ad esempio crepe e crateri). Puoi usare colori e/o linee. Cerca di includere le seguenti caratteristiche:\n- **Vulcaniche**:\nI due vulcani maggiormente attivi con fumi e anelli dovuti al deposito della lava: Pele, Promoteo\nNumerose caldere riempite di lava, ad esempio Loki Patera e le altre \u201cPatera\u201d\n- **Tettoniche**: (fratture nella crosta pi\u00f9 fragile)\nCatene montuose: Monte Haemus, monti Boosaule e gli altri \u201cmonti\u201d;\n- **Depositi**\nRegioni coperte di brillante zolfo gelato (ad esempio Bactria Regio)\nIn altri posti: flussi di lava ricoperti da gialli depositi sulfurei.\n###ESPLORAZIONE\nChiedi agli studenti dove atterrerebbero/costruirebbero un insediamento per effettuare ulteriori esplorazioni? Quale regione (o caratteristica) \u00e8 maggiormente significativa per l\u2019esplorazione? Perch\u00e9? Cosa vuoi esplorare? Quali strumenti/attrezzature/metodi useresti per l\u2019indagine? Cosa porteresti con te per questa ricerca?\n**Attivit\u00e0 3**: Il tuo sito di atterraggio. Dove atterreresti? Quale posto troveresti pi\u00f9 stimolante per l\u2019esplorazione? Trova il TUO sito di atterraggio. Segnalo con un simbolo. Assegna un nome al tuo sito di atterraggio. Annota i nomi a fianco di ciascun simboli.\n###TOPONOMASTICA\nChiedi agli studenti di leggere ad alta voce un nome dalla mappa. Chiedi cosa riescono a capire da questo nome, ad esempio cosa gli racconta il nome. I nomi sono in Latino dal momento che i pianeti non fanno parte di alcuna nazione e che il Latino \u00e8 considerato neutrale tra tutte le lingue internazionali. Chiedi agli studenti se a loro piace questo modo neutrale (Latino) di dargli un nome oppure se preferirebbero chiamarli in inglese (o nella lingua che parlano). Puoi spiegare il significato dei nomi che si trovano sulla mappa. Puoi trovare il loro equivalente in inglese su questo sito: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n**Attivit\u00e0 4**: I nomi. Dopo aver finito la parte grafica, creare la nomenclatura: scrivi i nomi delle caratteristiche che hai disegnato a fianco alla caratteristica stessa. Scrivi tre nome (puoi aggiungerne di pi\u00f9 dopo) sulla mappa. Puoi usare colori differenti o lettere per ogni tipologia di caratteristica (ad esempio lettere maiuscole per i continenti, colore rosso per il canale di lava ecc. - essere coerenti).\n###ASTRONOMIA, CLIMATOLOGIA, METEOROLOGIA\nChiedi agli studenti se c\u2019\u00e8 un\u2019atmosfera sul pianeta e perch\u00e9 pensano sia cos\u00ec. Trova dati sulle condizioni meteorologiche (temperatura superficiale minima e massima) sulla leggenda della mappa  o sulla dispensa. Non confondere i valori delle coordinate (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 ecc..) segnati sulla mappa con i valori delle temperature presenti sulla leggenda. \nChiedi agli studenti se sul pianeta c\u2019\u00e8 acqua in forma liquida o altri materiali liquidi e come fanno a saperlo. Confronta le temperature locali (minima e massima) con quelle di congelamento/ebollizione dell\u2019acqua. Quante sono le possibilit\u00e0 di trovare acqua?\n**Attivit\u00e0 5**: Previsioni del tempo per domani, basate sulle informazioni metereologiche della dispensa. Scegli almeno tre posti ed evidenzia i dati sul meteo: visualizza la temperatura minima/massima con numeri grandi. Considera che verso i poli fa pi\u00f9 freddo. A fianco ai numeri, descrivi il tempo attraverso dei simboli grafici che tu stesso disegnerai: chiaro (soleggiato), nuvoloso, piovoso, nebbia o qualunque altro fenomeno metereologico interessante, speciale che hai imparato dalle dispense. Trova i dati sulla temperatura minima/massima sulla legenda della mappa e sulle informazioni aggiuntive presenti sulle dispense.\nChiedi agli studenti di quali indumenti protettivi avrebbero bisogno se stessero esplorando la superficie lontano del proprio veicolo, usando i valori discussi precedentemente. Ad esempio, avranno bisogno di serbatoi di ossigeno, una tuta che mantiene la temperatura ambiente e la pressione ecc...\n**Attivit\u00e0 6**: Disegna una bandiera per Io e disegnala sulla mappa, per farlo basati sulle sue caratteristiche (Meteo, colore, geologia ecc..)\nChiedi agli studenti se creature, piante o animali potrebbero sopravvivere su Io, usando i valori forniti dalla legenda (temperatura, pressione - usa il concetto di acqua allo stato liquido = abitabilit\u00e0: se pu\u00f2 esserci acqua allo stato liquido, la vita pu\u00f2 (o pu\u00f2 non) esistere). Spiega che nessuna traccia o forma di vita presente o passata \u00e8 stata scoperta in nessun altro pianeta o luna del sistema solare n\u00e9 tantomeno su esopianeti al di fuori di esso, tuttavia, ci sono milioni di pianeti che non abbiamo mai esplorato. Quali tipi di creature possono esistere in quei luoghi? Di quale protezione/abilit\u00e0 avrebbero necessit\u00e0 per vivere? Che aspetto potrebbero avere? (ad esempio: pelo folto, oppure animali sotterranei ecc..). Cosa potrebbero mangiare? In che modo potrebbero comunicare tra loro? (ad esempio, senza aria non esiste nessun suono).\n###LEGENDA\n**Attivit\u00e0 7**: Disegna una legenda nel luogo in cui hai illustrato i tuoi simboli sulla mappa. Puoi raggrupparli per processo (ad esempio processi esogeni (atmosferico, eolico), endogeni (vulcanico, tettonico) e dovuti a un impatto). Scrivi il titolo \u201cLEGENDA\u201d, illustra i tuoi simboli e indica a quali caratteristiche corrispondono.\n**Compito per casa**: Chiedi agli studenti di comporre o disegnare storie usando i paesaggi della mappa come sfondo della storia, e le creature che ci abitano come protagonisti della storia. Una possibile trama: in che modo la superficie \u00e8 diventata come la conosciamo ora? (raccontato come una storia, non scientificamente). Puoi anche illustrare la storia.", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "Il linguaggio delle mappe e i testi di accompagnamento che riguardano i corpi sono tradotti in 11 lingue cos\u00ec se un insegnante non parla l\u2019inglese,pu\u00f2 usare i materiali per questa attivit\u00e0 nelle seguenti lingue: attualmente la mappa di Plutone \u00e8 esclusivamente in inglese.\nInglese: https://childrensmaps.wordpress.com/ \nFrancese, http://cartespourenfants.wordpress.com/ \nTedesco, http://kartenfuerkinder.wordpress.com/ \nUngherese, http://gyerekterkep.wordpress.com/ \nItaliano, http://mappeperbambini.wordpress.com/ \nPolacco, https://mapydladzieci.wordpress.com/ \nPortoghese, http://mapasparacriancas.wordpress.com/ \nRumeno (Gipsy) http://mapileshavorenge.wordpress.com/ \nRumeno, http://hartipentrucopii.wordpress.com/ \nRusso, http://kartydlyadetey.wordpress.com/ \nSpagnolo, http://mapasparaninos.wordpress.com/\nUlteriori letture:\nHargitai H. , Gede M. , Zimbelman J., K\u0151szeghy C., Sir\u00e1ly D., Marinangeli L., Barata T., L\u00f3pez I., Szak\u00e1cs A., D\u0119bniak K., Feuillet T., 2015.

Un asteroide viene chiamato meteorite se colpisce il suolo terrestre. Se evapora completamente nell'atmosfera terrestre prima dell'impatto col suolo, viene chiamato meteora. Di solito ci si riferisce alle meteore come \"stelle cadenti\". La maggior parte delle meteoriti sono composte di silicati o di una mescolanza di ferro e nichel. In passato, alcune enormi meteoriti hanno colpito la Terra. Sessantacinque milioni di anni fa, quasi il 90% delle specie animali (tra cui i dinosauri) si estinse quando un meteorite colp\u00ec la penisola dello Yucatan, Messico. Per fortuna che questo succede molto raramente! Siamo debitori di questo a Giove, che attrae molto asteroidi grazie alla forza di attrazione gravitazionale.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/Asteroid%20Ida.jpg) \n**Asteroide Ida**\n\n**Come si sono formati gli asteroidi? **\n\nLe particelle di polvere nel primitivo Sistema Solare si scontrarono, formando dei grumi pi\u00f9 grandi, noti come planetesimi. Questi poterono accrescersi attirando pi\u00f9 polvere con i loro campi gravitazionali; alcuni diventarono grandi abbastanza da formare i pianeti. Altri rimasero cos\u00ec, diventando asteroidi. Alcuni di questi asteroidi si scontrarono gli uni con gli altri (e con i primitivi pianeti), frammentandosi in asteroidi pi\u00f9 piccoli. Alcune di queste collisioni furono abbastanza lente da fondere gli asteroidi, formando asteroidi dalle forme strane.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/ESO%20antiope%20doublet.jpg)\n\n**Dove si trovano gli asteroidi?**\n\nMolti asteroidi formano grandi anelli o fasce intorno al Sole. Ci sono due fasce di asteroidi nel nostro Sistema Solare: la Fascia Principale degli Asteroidi (chiamata anche semplicemente Fascia degli Asteroidi) tra Marte e Giove, con migliaia di asteroidi (vedi l'immagine qui sotto) e la Fascia di Kuiper, chiamata cos\u00ec dal suo scopritore, una regione a forma di disco che si estende oltre l'orbita di Nettuno e che contiene innumerevoli asteroidi e molti pianeti nani, di cui Plutone \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 famoso.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b3a82191-92b5-47a3-81b4-b8a5d3164b35/UNAWE%20asteroid%20belt.jpg)\n\nLa maggior parte degli asteroidi si trova nella Fascia degli Asteroidi; tuttavia, ci sono degli asteroidi che non si muovono in quell'orbita e sono chiamati *Near Earth Objects* (NEO) che sta per \"Oggetti vicini alla Terra\". Alcuni di questi NEO possono raggiungere il nostro pianeta Terra. \n\n**Perch\u00e9 gli asteroidi sono importanti da studiare?**\n\nGli asteroidi fanno parte di un gruppo chiamato corpi minori del Sistema Solare. Asteroidi, comete e meteoroidi possono fornire preziose informazioni sull'evoluzione del nostro Sistema Solare. Inoltre, ci sono piccoli corpi chiamati meteoroidi, i residui della formazione del Sistema Solare. Questi meteoroidi possono essere piccoli come chicchi di riso. I meteoroidi incontrano costantemente la Terra, producendo ci\u00f2 che vediamo sul nostro pianeta sotto forma di \"stelle cadenti\".\n\n**\u00c8 vero che un asteroide pu\u00f2 colpire la Terra?**\n\nUn asteroide di 10 chilometri di diametro colp\u00ec la Terra 65 milioni di anni fa. Si presume che questo impatto asteroidale sulla Terra sia uno dei motivi per cui i dinosauri si sono estinti.\n\n**Comete**\n\nPotete inoltre raccontare agli studenti qualcosa sulle comete. Le comete sono come delle palle di neve sporca oppure blocchi di fango ghiacciati. Consistono in una miscela di ghiaccio (sia di acqua che di gas ghiacciati) e polvere. Come gli asteroidi, le comete ruotano attorno al Sole. In realt\u00e0, le loro orbite sono fortemente allungate rispetto a quelle dei pianeti. Ovvero, a volte esse si avvicinano molto al Sole, a volte rimangono molto lontano. Quando attraversano l'orbita di un pianeta, potrebbero entrare in collisione con esso. Ci\u00f2 accadde, ad esempio, nel 1994, quando la cometa Shoemaker-Levy entr\u00f2 in collisione con il pianeta Giove e si framment\u00f2 in vari pezzi. Quando le comete si avvicinano al Sole nella loro orbita, il ghiaccio nel loro nucleo si scioglie ed evapora. Ci\u00f2 si traduce in una bella coda, che pu\u00f2 essere chiaramente vista nel cielo notturno se la cometa passa abbastanza vicino alla Terra. Nel 2061 la cometa di Halley torner\u00e0 di nuovo vicino alla Terra. Questa cometa orbita attorno al nostro Sole in 76 anni.

Il sistema caratterizza il clima in base alla vegetazione nativa di un'area. Inoltre tiene conto delle temperature e delle precipitazioni annuali e mensili, nonch\u00e9 dalla stagionalit\u00e0 delle precipitazioni.\n\n**Clima continentale**. Nelle regioni con un clima continentale, la temperatura media \u00e8 superiore ai 10\u00b0C durante il periodo caldo e sotto i -3\u00b0C durante quelli pi\u00f9 freddi. Tali regioni solitamente si trovano all'interno dei continenti e sono piuttosto lontane dall'influenza degli oceani o di grandi superfici d'acqua. Poich\u00e9 terreni e rocce hanno una capacit\u00e0 termica pi\u00f9 bassa rispetto all'acqua, essi assorbono e perdono calore rapidamente. I climi continentali sono spesso relativamente secchi e la maggior parte dell'acqua trasportata da masse d'aria originate sugli oceani lontani viene persa in piogge durante il viaggio.\nTra le regioni della Terra che possiedono un clima continentale sono incluse la Siberia e la Russia centrale e la maggior parte del Nord America.

Quindi essi riscaldano un volume pi\u00f9 grande di acqua. I raggi del Sole sulla terra non penetrano molto oltre la superficie. Questo vuol dire che solo la superficie della terra \u00e8 calda.

Cold air is denser than warm air. This is the reason why hot air balloons can fly and even lift cargo.\n\nScientifically, this phenomenon is described by the ideal gas law and the buoyant force according the Archimedes\u2019 principle.\n\nHence, the buoyant force is equivalent to the gravitational force that is exerted on the displaced air.\n\nF<sub>up</sub> = F<sub>g,air,out</sub> = m<sub>air,out</sub> \u2219 g\n\nHere, m<sub>air,out</sub> is the mass of the displaced air. In the case of hot air balloons with volume V and the density of the air outside the balloon that was displaced \u03f1<sub>out</sub>,\n\nF<sub>up</sub> = \u03f1<sub>out</sub> \u2219V\u2219g\n\nBuoyancy is reached when the buoyant force is equivalent to the gravitational force (only the air is considered):\n\nF<sub>up</sub> = F<sub>g,air,in</sub> = m<sub>air,in</sub> \u2219 g = \u03f1<sub>in</sub> \u2219V\u2219g <br/>\nHence:<br/>\nF<sub>res</sub> = F<sub>up</sub> - F<sub>g,air,in</sub> = \u03f1<sub>out</sub> \u2219V\u2219g - \u03f1<sub>in</sub> \u2219V\u2219g = (\u03f1<sub>out</sub> -\n \u03f1<sub>in</sub>)\u2219V\u2219g\n\nSo the resulting force is governed by the difference between the densities of air inside and outside the balloon. For a hot air balloon, this density inside is changed by heating the air. This is where the gas law steps in. One way of writing it is as follows:\n\np\u2219V = m\u2219R<sub>s</sub>\u2219T\n\nm is the total gas mass and R<sub>s</sub> is a constant. Therefore, \n\n(p\u2219V)/(m\u2219T) = p/(\u03f1\u2219T) = const. \n\nSince a hot air balloon is open, the pressure inside and outside the balloon remains the same during the heating process. It is a constant as well. Therefore,\n\n\u03f1\u2219T = const.\n\nWhen heating of the air inside the balloon begins, both the density and temperature inside and outside are the same. Afterwards, both quantities differ. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:\n\n\u03f1<sub>in</sub> \u2219 T<sub>in</sub> = \u03f1<sub>out</sub> \u2219 T<sub>out</sub> \u21d4 \u03f1<sub>in</sub> = \u03f1<sub>out</sub> \u2219 T<sub>out</sub>/T<sub>in</sub>\n\nLet us now get back to the resulting buoyant force:\n\nF<sub>res</sub> = (\u03f1<sub>out</sub> - \u03f1<sub>in</sub>) \u2219V\u2219g\n\nThe two densities are now connected to the temperature change. Therefore,\n\n\u03f1<sub>out</sub> - \u03f1<sub>in</sub> = \u03f1<sub>out</sub> - (\u03f1<sub>out</sub> \u2219 T<sub>out</sub> / T<sub>in</sub>)  = \u03f1<sub>out</sub> \u2219 (1 - T<sub>out</sub> / T<sub>in</sub>),\n\nwhich leads to final expression for the resulting force of uplift as follows:\n\nF<sub>res</sub> = \u03f1<sub>out</sub> \u2219 (1 - T<sub>out</sub> / T<sub>in</sub>) \u2219V\u2219g.\n\nIn order for F<sub>res</sub> to be positive, we need\n\n1 - T<sub>out</sub> / T<sub>in</sub> > 0 \u21d4 T<sub>in</sub> > T<sub>out</sub>.\n\nSo, the hot air balloon (in fact, only the air inside it) rises if the air temperature inside the balloon is higher than the outside temperature.\n\n<br/>\n**The Sun and the global wind system**<br/>\nThe atmosphere of the Earth consists of air. We know that whenever it is heated, it rises up (see above). The atmosphere is heated by the Sun, which mainly heats the surface first, and this in turn heats the air close to the ground. Since warm air has a lower density than cool air, it produces an updraft which by convection drags the air up into the highest layers of the troposphere, about 10\u201315 km above the ground. While the air rises, it constantly cools down, which reduces the buoyant force. At some point, the uplift stops, and the air is diverted horizontally north and south.\n\nThis process is most effective at latitudes where the Sun is at its zenith, i.e. in a belt around the equator. This area is called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). It follows the apparent annual path of the Sun northward and southward during the seasons.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Layers_of_the_atmosphere_MN_altit_vCWWmGu.png)\n**Figure 1:** Layers of the atmosphere (The High Fin Sperm Whale, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Layers_of_the_atmosphere.PNG, \u2018Layers of the atmosphere\u2019, altitudes according to NASA (https://www.nasa.gov/\nmission_pages/sunearth/science/atmosphere-layers2.html) added by M. Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nCool air can store less water than warm air. Therefore, the rather humid air that rises in the ITCZ continuously loses its ability to store water. As a result, clouds form, from which water is eventually released as rain. In extreme cases, the convection can lead to severe weather phenomena like thunderstorms or even cyclones and hurricanes. This is the reason why the low latitudes around the equator are strongly affected by a humid, tropical climate with low-pressure areas and lots of rain. On satellite images, the ITCZ appears very prominent because of the cloud belt along the equator (see Figure 1). This demonstrates that satellite imagery can be an important tool to monitor the climate of the Earth.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Hurricane_Bill_in_First_Full_Disk_bAia1Is.jpg)\n**Figure 2:** Image obtained with the GOES 14 satellite. The belt of cloud formation around the ITCZ is clearly visible (NASA/GOES Science Team).\n\n<br/>\nThe air has now become dry. While it is pushed north and south to latitudes around 30\u00b0 north and south, the already dry air drops, heats up and is dried even more. This gives rise to the arid, subtropical climate we find in this region.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Hadley-Cells_Michelle_Weirathmueller.jpg)\n**Figure 3:** Schematic of the Hadley cell (\u2018The Waveform Diary\u2019 blog, The mystery of the shifting tropical rain belt, M. Weirathmueller, permission for reproduction granted).\n\n<br/>\nThe cycle of circulation closes with the air currents flowing back to the equatorial region and the ITCZ where they feed the convection again. Thus, we have seen that the ITCZ with the rising air causes a global belt of air circulating roughly between the tropics around the equator and the dry desert at approximately 30\u00b0 north and south. This belt is called the \u2018Hadley Cell\u2019 (see Figure 2).\n\nThe convection zone at the ITCZ and the connected Hadley zone is only a part of a much larger global air circulation system (see Figure 3). \n\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg.png)\n**Figure 4:** Global circulation of the Earth's atmosphere (Kaidor (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Earth_Global_Circulation_-_en.svg), \u2018Earth Global Circulation - en\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode)\n\n<br/>\n**Possible influence of climate change**<br/>\nWe have seen that thermal energy is drives wind, rain and temperature, i.e. the weather. Therefore, it seems plausible that the more the heat stored in the atmosphere, the greater is the energy available to influence the weather. Since the resulting buoyant force depends on temperature differences, especially between the Earth\u2019s surface and high altitudes, we should expect that processes like the ones seen in the ITCZ would be amplified.\n\nIn fact, there are already indications that along with the phenomenon of a gradual increase in global mean air temperatures through recent decades (global warming), extreme weather situations have increased in number and severity (http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/impacts/global-warming-rain-snow-tornadoes.html). This is supported by the findings of recent climate studies (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170307100337.htm). \n\n", "fulldesc": "###**INTRODUCTION: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS**\n\nShow the students a globe or a global map and ask them if they can identify the equator.\n\nQ: Where are the poles? Where does the equator lie relative to the poles?\nA: The equator is the line or circumference on the globe half way between the poles.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Kilometre_definition.svg_8EwR0DA.png) \n**Figure 5:** Illustration of a globe and the position of the equator relative to the North Pole (US Government).\n\n<br/>\nIf possible, let the students use an online map tool to investigate geographic and satellite images of the equatorial region. The map tool may also be projected on a single computer. Here are some possible map services with satellite imagery:<br/> \nhttps://maps.google.com\nhttps://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1\n\nQ: Can you name countries that touch the equator? Do you know any cities close to it? <br/>\nA: e.g. Ecuador (Quito, Galapagos), Brazil, Gabon (Libreville), Congo, Uganda (Kampala), Kenya, Malaysia, Indonesia.\n\nQ: What is the typical vegetation there? <br/>\nA closer look at the satellite images helps to answer the question.\nA: Rainforest.\n\nQ: What is the typical weather there (humid or dry, cold or warm)?<br/>\nA: Humid and warm, with lots of rain.\n\nQ: Can you think of a reason for why it is so warm there all year? Show them a model of the Sun-Earth-System (Figure 5).<br/>\nA: The Sun is the main heating source. Near the equator, it is always almost directly above.\n\nQ: The air is heated by the hot surface of the Earth. What happens with hot air? Imagine a hot air balloon.<br/>\nA: Warm/hot air rises above cold air.\n\nQ: How would you be able to recognise that air rises?<br/>\nA: Wind\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Irradiation.png)\n**Figure 6:** Illustration of the Earth by the Sun. Looking from the equator, the Sun is almost always directly above (Przemyslaw \u2018Blueshade\u2019 Idzkiewicz, http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Earth-lighting-equinox_EN.png, \u2018Earth-lighting-equinox EN\u2019, solar light beams at different latitudes added by Markus Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode).\n\n###**ACTIVITY 1: FLYING FLAMES**\nWARNING! This activity is only suitable for students who are responsible enough to handle a flame. Be sure to provide a fireproof environment and to supervise the students during the experiment. Lighters or matches should be distributed only to small groups of students at a time. If in doubt, the experiment should be demonstrated by the teacher.\n\nSmoke detectors may have to be disabled for this activity.\n\nUse a fireproof surface. A china plate or a piece of tinfoil may be used to protect the surface of normal desks or tables.\n\nIn this activity, the students will experience how warm air rises above cool air. The hot air produced by a burning piece of very light paper produces its own uplift and rises up. This experiment should produce a qualitative result, that is, the exact uplift force is not so important.\n\nGather the following items, one set per group (or one for the teacher only, if carried out as a demonstration):\n- paper handkerchief, napkin or dual chamber tea bag\n- matches or lighter\n- plate or/and tinfoil\n- scissors\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/TeaBag.jpg)\n**Figure 7:** Illustration of the instructions (own work).\n\nA video with instructions and explanations is available at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKF3OKxwM8g\n\nDistribute the students in groups of two (suggested).\n\n1.\tPrepare the wick:<br/>\na. Paper handkerchiefs and napkins consist of several layers. Take only one and cut off one quarter.<br/>\nb. If a tea bag is used, cut off the top and empty the bag. Unfold it.\n2.\tForm a tube (napkin, handkerchief, tea bag) of a few centimetres and put it on the plate, standing upright. It should stand stably. Avoid abrupt and fast movements to prevent the moving air from blowing the wick away.\n3.\tLight it.\n\nDiscuss with the students what happened. Let the students describe in detail what they saw. While the wick burns down, the paper lifts off at some point.\n\nQ: What happened to the air around the burning paper?<br/>\nA: It was heated.\n\nQ: What happens with heated air?<br/>\nA: It rises.\n\nQ: Can you explain why in the end, the burning paper lifted off?<br/>\nA: It was dragged along with the rising air.\n\n\n###**ACTIVITY 2: UPDRAFT TOWER **\nThis activity demonstrates how heated air rises. As long as the heating source is present, a continuous updraft of the heated air is generated. The students will experience this phenomenon by building a model of an updraft tower. Subsequently, the concept of air circulation can be used to explain the process of terrestrial atmospheric circulation systems and the Intertropical Convergence Zone.\n\nTell the students that they will now build a model of such a tower. Tell them that it is a good way to demonstrate vertical wind on a small scale.\n\nGather the following items, one set per group:\n- scissors\n- flat nose pliers, if available\n- glue (for cardboard)\n- pencil or similar pointed object\n- aluminium wrap of a tea light\n- drawing pin\n\nFor either of the following alternatives:\n\n*Alternative 1*\n- cardboard tube (inner part of a kitchen roll)\n- black paint and brush or black coloured paper\n- one piece of cardboard (approx. 1 cm wide, 8 cm long)\n\n*Alternative 2*\n- construction template provided with this sheet\n- black cardboard (22 cm \u00d7 20 cm)\n- one piece of card board (approx. 1 cm wide, 12 cm long, see template)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/tower_01.jpg)\n**Figure 8:** Items needed for building an updraft tower model (Picture: M. Nielbock).\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**_Construction Template (scaled down version, original version to be attached)_**\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Figure 8plus.png)\n<br/>\n\n**_Building Instructions_** <br/>\n*Alternative 1:* <br/> \nThe first version may be simpler to produce but may not be as effective, because the cardboard tube used in this example may a bit too narrow. <br/> 1. Paint the outside of the cardboard tube black or glue it with black paper.\n\n*Alternative 2:*<br/> \nThe second version is especially designed to match the diameters of the tower and the fan. <br/> 1. Prepare the black cardboard according to the construction template provided. <br/> 2. Roll the cardboard perpendicularly to the hashed area. <br/> 3. Glue the tube at the hashed area. <br/> 4. Cut out the grey areas or cut them from bottom to top and fold them up to form flaps.\n\n ![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/tower_02.jpg)\n **Figure 9:** Set of items with the tower already built (Picture: M. Nielbock).\n\n *Common steps:*<br/>5. Now we produce the fan using the tea light wrap. This part is quite delicate and has to be done very carefully. <br/> 6. Cut 16 equal sections into the walls of the tea light wrap. <br/> 7. Flatten the sections outside to the bottom of the wrap. <br/> 8. Extend the cuts to the inner circle of the bottom of the wrap. <br/> 9. Press the pencil exactly at the centre of the fan to form a small dent. Be careful not to punch a hole. <br/> 10. Bend all 16 wings of the fan around an axis from the centre to the edge. Use the pliers if available. <br/> 11. Punch the drawing pin through the centre and from the back of the small piece of cardboard. <br/> 12. Glue the small piece of cardboard to the inside at the top of the tube. It should form an arc.\n\n ![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/tower_03.jpg)\n **Figure 10:** Set of items with the tower and the fan (Picture: M. Nielbock). \n\n<br/>13. Put the fan on top of the drawing pin. <br/> 14. Balance the fan by bending the wings up and down.\n\n ![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/tower_04.jpg)\n **Figure 11:** The finished updraft tower model (Picture: M. Nielbock).\n\n<br/>15. Illuminate the side of the tower with a strong lamp. <br/> 16. Watch the fan rotate.\n\nDiscuss the results with the students.\n\nQ: Why does the fan rotate?<br/>\nA: The air inside the tower is heated up and streams upward.\n\nQ: How is the air heated? Remember that the lamp does not shine inside the tower.<br/>\nA: The lamp heats the black tower, which in turn heats the air inside.\n\nQ: What are the holes at the bottom for?<br/>\nA: They permit the tower to be replenished with fresh air.\n\nQ: If you compare this with the situation on Earth, what does the Sun do in the belt around the equator? What happens with the surface and the air above?<br/>\nA: The Sun heats the ground which, in turn, heats the air. Just like the model of the updraft tower, the heated air rises and produces a continuous updraft of air.\n\nQ: Can you imagine what happens with the air when it reaches high altitudes?<br/>\nA: The air cools down and the moisture condenses to rain.\n\nQ: Coming back to the updraft tower: it had flaps at the bottom to allow the air in the tower to be replenished. The same happens on Earth. What do we call horizontal air flows?<br/>\nA: Wind.\n\n\n###**ACTIVITY 3: WORKSHEET- THE WIND ENGINE OF THE EARTH**\nWe have seen in the experiments that a heat source can heat up air and cause an upward flow. The same process happens on Earth.\n\nQ: Look at Figure 5. Where on Earth does the Sun heat most efficiently?<br/>\nA: Around the equator\n\nQ: Heating the air directly is quite inefficient. When you think about the updraft tower experiment, the lamp did not heat the air. Describe the process by which solar energy eventually heats the air.<br/>\nA: The irradiation from the Sun heats the ground, which in turn heats the air. This is more efficient next to the surface than at higher altitudes.\n\nQ: Which part of the atmospheric layers is heated strongest?<br/>\nA: The one next to the surface.\n\nIndicate the correct attributions: <br/>\nThe air close to the surface of the Earth is warm/~~cold~~. <br/>\nThe air at high altitudes above the ground is ~~warm~~/cold.\n\nQ: What happens with the air close to the surface? Consider the temperature differences between low and high altitudes.<br/>\nA: It rises above cooler air.\n\nQ: Warm air can store more water than cold air. What happens when air rises into the higher layers of the atmosphere? Think of boiling water at home when the hot air meets the cold air or cold surfaces.<br/>\nA: The water vapour condenses, first to clouds and eventually to larger drops and rain.\n\nQ: Can you explain why the equatorial regions of the Earth experience so much rain during the year?<br/>\nA: Warm humid air is driven up to cooler atmospheric layers where the water condenses to rain. This is a process that works almost all year.\n\nQ: This region around the equator is also called the Intertropical Convergence Zone, abbreviated as ITCZ. At some point, the air cannot rise any higher. It is diverted north and south. At these high altitudes, the air constantly cools down. What happens with cold air?<br/>\nA: Cold air drops closer to the ground.\n\nQ: We just mentioned that cold air can store less water than warm air. Can you explain why the desert areas north and south of the equator are so dry? What happens with the air when it drops back to the surface?<br/>\nA: When the warm air rises up to cooler layers, it cannot store water as efficiently falls down as rain. The air is dried by this process. When this air drops, it is heated up and potentially can store more water. Without replenishment with humid air, the air becomes even drier.\n\nQ: Back at the surface, the air streams towards the equatorial region, where they converge (ITCZ). These are winds we call \u2018trade winds\u2019. Can you imagine why they are called this?<br/>\nA: Trade winds are a fairly constant phenomenon that helped cargo ships to sail long distances. Its direction is fairly stable as well, so ships do not get lost often.\n\nQ: Try to predict what would happen with the winds and weather, in general, if the temperature continues to rise.<br/>\nA: Temperature is the main engine of updraft. Higher temperatures also cause more water to be evaporated and enrich the air. As a result, one should expect more extreme phenomena related to the ITCZ.\n\nQ: This is actually happening right now. It is called global warming. Explain what would happen if we do not stop this process.<br/>\nA: This aspect of the climate change will lead to more severe weather, especially near the tropics.\n\nWe have constructed an entire circulation system that begins and ends at the equatorial region. This system is called the Hadley Cell. Can you draw a schematic with the most relevant elements and processes? Use the prepared sketch below as a starting point.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4b2bd1be-1e9c-4e8e-b57e-2ce8103004ba/Figure 11plus_VAsUhoS.png)\n\n\n", "curriculum": "Country | Level | Subject | Exam Board | Section\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nUK | KS2 | Geography | - | **Physical geography**<br/> <br/> * Describe and understand key aspects of physical geography, including climate zones, biomes and vegetation belts, rivers, mountains, volcanoes and earthquakes and the water cycle. \nUK | KS3 | Geography | - | **Locational knowledge**<br/> <br/> * Expand their locational knowledge and deepen their spatial awareness of the world\u2019s countries using maps to focus on Africa, Russia, Asia (including China and India), and the Middle East, focusing on their environmental regions, including polar and hot deserts, key physical and human characteristics, countries and major cities.", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "This activity consists of three parts that illustrate the power of the Sun that drives a global air circulation system that is also responsible for tropical and subtropical climate zones.

Riguarda la *geografia/geologia dei pianeti* e il modo in cui si decifrano e si creano mappe (rappresentazioni cartografiche). Alle scuole elementari, il concetto di 'geografia' (che pu\u00f2 appartenere ad un generico programma di 'scienze') coinvolge concetti che interessano diverse branche delle Scienze della Terra ed Atmosferiche, per esempio la geologia, la geomorfologia, la cartografia, la meteorologia e la climatologia. Noi seguiamo questa concezione.\n\n**Di che cosa NON si interessa questa attivit\u00e0?** Non \u00e8 una pratica nell'interpretazione delle immagini planetarie. Non \u00e8 un'introduzione alle strutture del Sistema Solare o all'Astronomia. L'Astronomia \u00e8 una disciplina totalmente diversa dalla scienza planetaria. I soggetti della Planetologia sono i pianeti e un campo importante di questa \u00e8 costituito dall'*astrogeologia*, che studia la geologia della superficie dei pianeti e delle lune. Quest'attivit\u00e0 \u00e8 astrogeologica e cartografica. L'Astronomia si interessa, per esempio, di stelle, galassie e del moto dei pianeti.\n\n**Difficolt\u00e0 della cartografia**: le mappe mostrano i corpi celesti secondo la proiezione di Lambert (che propone due separati punti di vista degli emisferi. Questo richiede una spiegazione aggiuntiva dell'insegnante su come sia possibile proiettare due 'lati' di una stessa sfera su due piani circolari, che non equivale ad osservare due corpi celesti differenti).\n\n**Astrobiologia**: si interessa delle creature 'aliene'; sulla mappa, ogni caratteristica morfologica \u00e8 reale ed \u00e8 collocata nella sua posizione effettiva; tuttavia, le creature viventi sono immaginarie e, perci\u00f2, anche in questo caso \u00e8 necessaria la spiegazione dell'insegnante cos\u00ec che gli studenti non credano che esseri umani o 'alieni' vivano su pianeti o lune. Deve essere chiarito che nessun segno di vita passata o presente \u00e8 stata mai evidenziata su pianeti o lune al di fuori della Terra. Questa sarebbe una buona occasione per parlare dei miliardi di esopianeti esistenti nell\u2019universo che, a differenza della maggior parte dei pianeti extra-terrestri e delle lune nel nostro Sistema Solare, mostrano condizioni molto pi\u00f9 favorevoli alla vita. \nUn nuovo ambito della scienza planetaria \u00e8 l'esoplanetologia, che si occupa dei pianeti al di fuori del Sistema Solare. Molti di quegli esopianeti ed esolune sono totalmente diversi da quelli del nostro sistema planetario. Il principio base delle missioni spaziali \u00e8 la ricerca della vita. Su Marte, gli scienziati sono alla ricerca di regioni, in cui potrebbe essersi sviluppata vita in passato o ripari geologici in cui avrebbe potuto sopravvivere (all\u2019interno di caverne, nel sottosuolo, tra le rocce, negli strati della superficie contenenti acqua, ecc\u2026). Questo \u00e8 il motivo per il quale la NASA stava ricercando prove della presenza di acqua. Ora che sono state identificate sia le zone contenenti acqua (sotto forma di ghiaccio) che le diverse unit\u00e0 geologiche, stanno perlustrando il pianeta per trovare segni di vita presente o passata. Europa potrebbe avere un oceano al di sotto della sua superficie, che si espone allo spazio in corrispondenza delle fratture del terreno. Gli scienziati, oggi, sono alla ricerca di forme di vita che si sviluppino a partire dagli stessi elementi da cui si generarono quelle terrestri, come ad esempio il carbonio, da cui si origina l\u2018acqua; per questo stanno cercando aree dove l'acqua possa presentarsi nello stato liquido. Possono esistere anche altre forme di vita, ma, non avendo conoscenze a riguardo e non sapendo come identificarle, l\u2019obiettivo primario \u00e8 di individuare quelle fondate sul carbonio.\n\n**Programmi spaziali**: oltre alla ricerca della vita e di corpi celesti o di zone che siano ospitali per creature simil-terrestri, i programmi spaziali sono motivati dalla competizione tra le nazioni. Le esplorazioni spaziali favoriscono la comprensione dei processi geologici attivi nel nostro pianeta e quelli del suo passato e futuro. Per esempio, l'intenso effetto serra su Venere pu\u00f2 aiutare a predire la manifestazione di processi simili sulla Terra oppure dai crateri da impatto si pu\u00f2 individuare l'aspetto che aveva la Terra 4 miliardi di anni fa. Uno dei risultati inaspettati raggiunti dal programma Apollo, che invi\u00f2 uomini sulla Luna, fu il cosiddetto l'*overview effect* (la 'veduta d\u2019insieme'): questa fu la prima volta - e, finora, l'unica - in cui l'occhio umano vide il nostro pianeta come una fragile 'biglia blu' in relazione allo spazio oscuro, che ha cambiato la percezione del mondo e della nostra posizione nell'universo.\n\n**Ricerca spaziale**: gli scienziati possono intraprendere ricerche individuali su una singola struttura morfologica per anni, tentando di spiegare come e quando si \u00e8 formata; altri ricostruiscono regioni specifiche in dettaglio e classificano le caratteristiche raffigurate sulle mappe. Dopo la pubblicazione dei risultati della ricerca, essa diventa un piccolo mattoncino per la costruzione del grande edificio che \u00e8 la scienza planetaria e altri scienziati possono usufruirne al fine di migliorare i loro modelli evolutivi riguardo la superficie terrestre oppure usarli nelle proprie ricerche. Gran parte dei contenuti presenti in queste mappe sono stati ottenuti negli ultimi decenni e, in alcuni casi, solo da pochi anni. L'origine di alcune strutture morfologiche non \u00e8 stata ancora completamente chiarita.\n\n###Descrizione generale dei parametri che possono essere discussi per definire il pianeta o la luna scelti.\n**Tipo di corpo celeste**: Pianeta o Luna. I pianeti orbitano intorno al Sole, mentre le Lune orbitano intorno ad un pianeta. Generalmente, una Luna rivolge sempre la stessa faccia verso il suo pianeta (per il fenomeno delle maree).\n**Composizione**: i corpi celesti rocciosi sono fatti di silicati (ad esempio, la Terra); quelli ghiacciati sono composti per lo pi\u00f9 da ghiaccio ed in piccola parte da roccia (ad esempio, Europa). In questi pianeti, infatti, le montagne e le pianure non sono altro che ghiaccio solido e, per questo, sono situati solo nelle regioni pi\u00f9 esterne e fredde del Sistema Solare.     \n**Atmosfera**: l'atmosfera \u00e8 presente solo nel caso in cui la gravit\u00e0 (e quindi le dimensioni) del corpo celeste sia sufficientemente forte da attrarre le molecole di gas, non permettendogli di sfuggire nello spazio. Se il corpo \u00e8 freddo, si rivela pi\u00f9 semplice stringere a s\u00e9 le molecole.\n**Elementi allo stato liquido**: l'elemento allo stato liquido caratteristico del corpo celeste pu\u00f2 essere l\u2019acqua nelle regioni pi\u00f9 interne del Sistema Solare, mentre possono presentarsi metano, etano ed azoto nelle regioni pi\u00f9 esterne. Lo stato liquido compare soltanto in presenza dell\u2019atmosfera, che esercita una pressione sulla superficie; se la pressione atmosferica \u00e8 troppo bassa, i liquidi evaporano o sublimano; se invece, \u00e8 troppo alta, congelano. Essi evaporano anche nel caso in cui la temperatura risultasse troppo elevata. L'acqua potrebbe esistere a livello del sottosuolo.\n**Clima**: elevata escursione termica (oscillazione della temperatura tra il giorno e la notte) e fenomeni di precipitazione.\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: caratteristiche generate da forze interne al pianeta. Il fenomeno del **vulcanesimo**, per manifestarsi, richiede la presenza di strati fusi nella composizione del corpo celeste. Il calore \u00e8 stato prodotto dal processo di formazione del pianeta (calore da impatto o da aggregazione di particelle) oppure dal processo di decadimento radioattivo degli elementi, che risulta irreversibile. I corpi celesti pi\u00f9 piccoli si raffreddano pi\u00f9 velocemente di quelli grandi; per questo, il vulcanesimo si verifica solo nei pianeti di maggiori dimensioni o, eccezionalmente, nel caso in cui l'interno del corpo celeste fosse permanentemente riscaldato. Ci\u00f2 accade per le lune su orbite ellittiche, dove le forze di marea producono calore endogeno (per esempio, Io). Le strutture caratteristiche di origine **tettonica** sono generate dagli stress che subisce la crosta pi\u00f9 friabile: le fratture hanno origine da fenomeni tettonici che si verificano durante i terremoti, i quali, sono generati da movimenti interni del corpo celeste, in parte dovuti al suo calore endogeno. I vulcani si sviluppano in altitudine con l\u2019accumularsi di lava verso l'alto; tuttavia, essi possono collassare su s\u00e9 stessi, dando origine e caldere simili a crateri.\n**Caratteristiche esogene**: strutture dai processi che si verificano sulla superficie del pianeta o nella sua atmosfera, tra le quali si includono quelle di natura eolica (venti), fluviale (fiumi), lacustre (laghi), oceanica.\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: strutture generate da collisioni con altri corpi (piccoli crateri e grandi bacini da impatto). I crateri pi\u00f9 giovani presentano raggi lineari che si sviluppano in senso radiale, prodotti dai materiali espulsi durante la loro formazione.\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: le strutture pi\u00f9 comuni sono i crateri; gran parte dei quali si \u00e8 formata poco dopo la nascita del Sistema Solare. E' raro trovare crateri sulle superfici di recente origine, perch\u00e9 la formazione di nuovo terreno ha ricoperto i crateri presenti, seppellendoli. I processi sedimentari includono la formazione di pianure vulcaniche, le erosioni fluviali e la subduzione delle placche tettoniche.\n**Caratteristiche peculiari**: le strutture che si trovano esclusivamente su quel corpo celeste possono essere generate da specifiche condizioni atmosferiche o climatiche, oppure essere i residui di un evento inusuale verificatosi in passato.\n**Condizioni che non rendono possibile la vita**: la vita, qui, sarebbe in grado di nascere e riprodursi; la sua evoluzione potrebbe essere impedita dalle temperature eccessivamente basse nel sottosuolo ed eccessivamente alte ad alta quota, dall\u2019assenza di atmosfera, acqua o magnetosfera (che protegge i corpi celesti dal danno delle radiazioni emesse dai venti solari). \n**Nomenclatura**: i nomi possono essere proposti dagli scienziati che studiano la regione o la struttura morfologica presa in esame e vengono successivamente approvati dall'Unione Internazionale Astronomica, specializzata nella nomenclatura astronomica. Ogni tipo di struttura geologica ed ogni corpo celeste hanno un motivo specifico (per esempio, gli dei del fuoco per Io), che si distinguono dai termini generici (come 'montagna') che sono indicati in lingua latina per assicurare la neutralit\u00e0 di linguaggio. Ci\u00f2 rispetta anche le tradizioni geografiche del 1600, quando le prime mappe delle lune venivano create in Europa, usando nomi in lingua latina.\n**Et\u00e0**: l'et\u00e0 del pianeta \u00e8 definibile dalla morfologia della sua superficie; la presenza di numerosi crateri sulla superficie indica un'et\u00e0 di formazione pi\u00f9 antica (4 miliardi di anni fa), mentre, se in minore quantit\u00e0, si stima che la superficie abbia un\u2019origine pi\u00f9 recente (da 0 a 3 miliardi di anni fa). Nel Sistema Solare, poco dopo la sua nascita (circa 4 miliardi di anni fa), c'erano numerosi oggetti di piccole dimensioni che potevano impattare sui corpi celesti, generando crateri. Col passare del tempo, il loro numero decresceva sempre pi\u00f9, per le avvenute collisioni con i pianeti o perch\u00e9 furono allontanati dal sistema planetario dal loro campo gravitazionale.\n\n**Forme delle strutture geologiche**:  \n**Circolare**: si evidenza generalmente in un cratere da impatto ed occasionalmente in caldere di natura vulcanica.\n**Lineare**: come per le depressioni (fratture tettoniche) o per gli altopiani (dune, dorsali, montagne).\n**Sinuosa**: per fiumi o canali di lava.\n**Lobare**: per crateri da impatto ricchi d\u2019acqua, materiali piroclastici (detriti espulsi da un cratere o un vulcano), ghiacciai, frane.\n**Radiale**: per i raggi che si propagano da crateri da impatto.\n**Concentrica**: si evidenza nel margine anulare di un cratere.\n\nConfronto con le caratteristiche della Terra: (per fruire del planetario terrestre, utilizzare http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html oppure Google map).\n\n**Tipo di corpo celeste**: pianeta\n**Composizione**: rocciosa\n**Atmosfera**: presente\n**Elementi allo stato liquido**: acqua\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: vulcani, faglie e placche tettoniche (proprie esclusivamente della Terra)\n**Caratteristiche esogene**: fiumi, laghi, dune, pianure alluvionali, foci a delta, ghiacciai. Le strutture morfologiche ghiacciate, sulla Terra, non lo sono permanentemente; infatti, per gran parte dell\u2019anno, non sono presenti calotte glaciali.\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: si rilevano pi\u00f9 di 100 crateri da impatto, molti dei quali non permanenti poich\u00e9 sono stati ricoperti, erosi, distrutti dalla subduzione delle placche tettoniche, oppure danneggiati dall'acqua.\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: oceani, montagne, pianure, fiumi\n**Caratteristiche peculiari**: ghiacciai\n**Condizioni che non permettono la sopravvivenza**: si individuano nelle regioni con clima troppo secco (dove non esiste acqua allo stato liquido, come nei deserti) o troppo freddo (anche qui senza acqua liquida, come in Antartide)\n**Et\u00e0**: per gran parte molto giovane, con regioni pi\u00f9 antiche, datate 1 miliardo di anni fa.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b9a1e2c3-1933-407f-9b07-f8eecca1c5ae/olympus.jpg)\nComparazione tra le dimensioni delle pi\u00f9 alte montagne terrestri ed il Monte Olimpo marziano.", "fulldesc": "L'insegnante si deve dotare della mappa di Marte in forma stampata, di dimensioni tali da essere leggibile e fruibile dagli studenti, oppure in forma digitale, proiettata ad alta risoluzione.\n\nA questo punto, si possono scegliere uno o pi\u00f9 tra i seguenti sottoargomenti proposti per un'attivit\u00e0 svolta in classe, con o senza le dispense, sulle quali sono esplicate le istruzioni per svolgere le attivit\u00e0.\n\nLeggere la prima pagina delle dispense con gli studenti, chiedendo di sottolineare tutti i termini che non conoscono, per poterglieli successivamente spiegare.\n\n###Cartografia\n\nMostrare la mappa alla classe e chiedere agli studenti perch\u00e9 la raffigurazione del corpo celeste \u00e8 circolare (per esempio, perch\u00e9 il pianeta \u00e8 sferico). Chiedere perch\u00e9 ci sono due mappe circolari (emisferi). Spiegare che una sfera \u00e8 rappresentata da due proiezioni circolari e quelli sono i due lati di una singola sfera. Identifichiamo quella a sinistra come emisfero ovest e quella a destra come emisfero est.\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 1**\n- Disegnare l'Equatore (una linea orizzontale al centro dei due cerchi)\n- Indicare i poli (in entrambi gli emisferi)\n- Scrivere il nome del corpo celeste come titolo della mappa.\n\nParagonare la rappresentazione cartografica con la fotografia reale. (OSSERVARE LA FIGURA 1 SULLE DISPENSE) Chiedere di identificare le differenze tra le due immagini. Sulla cartografia \u00e8 stata applicata una semplificazione generale, dando pi\u00f9 enfasi alle strutture pi\u00f9 importanti, che non sono necessariamente le pi\u00f9 evidenti sulla fotografia. La superficie dei pianeti con una spessa atmosfera non \u00e8 visibile dalle fotografie. I colori utilizzati sulla mappa possono essere diversi da quelli reali. Quali elementi, che sono assenti sulla foto, sono, invece, presenti sulla mappa? Perch\u00e9 sono necessari? (NOTA: le creature aliene NON SONO REALI).\n\n###Geologia\n\nChiedere alla classe quali informazioni morfologiche possono ricavare dalla mappa. Identificare almeno un tipo tra le caratteristiche riconosciute (Vedere l'Attivit\u00e0 2 sulle dispense per averne una lista completa).\n\nIdentificare le strutture geologiche endogene che hanno avuto origine dal magma presente al di sotto della superficie (di natura vulcanica: vulcani, correnti di lava; di natura tettonica: crepe, fratture). Identificare le strutture geologiche esogene che hanno avuto origine da processi superficiali, verificatosi in pianeti dotati di atmosfera (dal vento: dune, deserti; dall\u2019acqua: fenomeni meteorologici, fiumi, oceani, laghi, sedimenti). Identificare le strutture geologiche cosmogeniche che hanno avuto origine da collisioni (crateri da impatto o bacini prodotti da asteroidi o comete provenienti dallo spazio).\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 2** - Mappa grafica. Utilizzando la mappa, disegnarne un abbozzo semplificato, delineando soltanto i profili delle strutture di grandi dimensioni e di maggior importanza (disegnarne di diversi tipi, ad esempio, spaccature nel terreno e crateri). Si pu\u00f2 usufruire di colori o righe.\n\nProvare a includere anche le caratteristiche:\n- **Di natura sedimentaria o lavica**:\nLe pianure settentrionali (raffigurate in giallo)\n- **Da impatto**:\nGli altopiani meridionali, dove sono presenti numerosi crateri (raffigurati in arancione)\nDue grandi bacini da impatto (Argyre Planitia e Hellas Planitia)\n- **Di natura Tettonica**: (le fratture in corrispondenza delle zone pi\u00f9 fragili della crosta)\nLa depressione della Valles Marineris e i suoi canali\n- **Di natura Vulcanica**:\nMons Olympus e gli altri tre vulcani nelle vicinanze; il vulcano Elysium Mons.\n- **Di natura Glaciale**: (tutto ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 relativo al ghiaccio)\nLe due calotte polari\n- **Le sonde pi\u00f9 famose**:\nViking 1-2, Phoenix, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity\n\n###Esplorazione\n\nChiedere agli studenti dove sbarcherebbero e instaurerebbero l'insediamento per ulteriori esplorazioni. Quale regione o formazione geologica vale la pena riesplorare? Perch\u00e9? Cosa vorrebbero analizzare? Di quali strumenti/metodi si servirebbero per l'investigazione? Cosa porterebbero con s\u00e9 per agevolare la ricerca?\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 3** - Il tuo punto di sbarco. Dove sbarcheresti? Quale regione credi sia pi\u00f9 emozionante esplorare? Trova il TUO punto di sbarco.\nIndicalo con un simbolo. Denominalo. Scrivine il nome accanto al simbolo corrispondente.\n\n###Toponomastica\n\nChiedere agli studenti di leggere ad alta voce un nome sulla mappa e di spiegare cosa possono supporre da questo. I nomi sono in Latino dato che i pianeti non appartengono a nessuna nazione e il Latino \u00e8 considerato un linguaggio neutrale, con valenza internazionale. Chiedere agli studenti se piace questa nomenclatura 'neutrale' (in Latino) oppure se preferirebbero che si utilizzasse l'Inglese (o la propria lingua d'origine). Si possono spiegare i significati dei nomi sulla mappa e trovare gli equivalenti inglesi nel seguente sito: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 4** - Nomi. Dopo aver completato la parte grafica, ideare la nomenclatura: scrivere i nomi accanto alle strutture geologiche corrispondenti. Scrivere tre nomi sulla mappa (se ne possono aggiungere altri in seguito). Si possono utilizzare diversi colori e lettere a seconda del tipo di elemento da definire (per esempio, lettere maiuscole per i continenti, il colore rosso per i canali di lava, ecc\u2026 - sii coerente e costante).\n\n###Astronomia, climatologia, meteorologia\n\nChiedere agli studenti se \u00e8 presente l'atmosfera sul pianeta ed il perch\u00e9 della loro risposta.\n\nTrovare informazioni riguardo il clima (le temperature superficiali massime e minime) sul pannello della mappa o sulle dispense. Non confondere le coordinate (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, ecc\u2026) indicate sulla mappa con le temperature indicate sul pannello.\n\nChiedere agli studenti se, sul pianeta, \u00e8 presente acqua, oppure altri materiali allo stato liquido, e come lo possono supporre. Confrontare i valori locali che la temperatura assume (la massima, quando l\u2019acqua bolle, e la minima, quando congela). Qual \u00e8 la probabilit\u00e0 di trovare acqua allo stato liquido?\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 5** - Previsioni del tempo per \"domani\", basandosi sulle informazioni climatiche presenti sulle dispense. Scegliere almeno tre luoghi e indicarne i dati climatici: indicare la temperatura massima e la minima nella tua scala di misura (Celsius o Fahrenheit), scrivendo i valori in GRANDE. Considerare che in prossimit\u00e0 dei poli le temperature risultano pi\u00f9 basse. Accanto ai valori numerici, indicare il tempo meteorologico con un simbolo grafico di tua ideazione: sereno (soleggiato), nuvoloso, piovoso, nebbioso, o altre condizioni climatiche interessanti che si ricavano dalle dispense.\nTrovare i dati relativi alle temperature minime e massime sulla mappa ed altre informazioni aggiuntive sulle dispense.\n\nChiedere agli studenti di quali indumenti di protezione avrebbero bisogno se dovessero esplorare la superficie del pianeta lontano dai loro veicoli, basandosi sui valori che sono stati individuati precedentemente. Per esempio, potrebbero necessitare di bombole di ossigeno, abiti che possano mantenere la temperatura e la pressione ambientale, ecc\u2026\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 6** - Ideare una bandiera per Marte e raffigurarla sulla mappa, basandosi sulle caratteristiche del pianeta (clima, colori, geologia, ecc\u2026).\n\nChiedere agli studenti se creature, piante o animali potrebbero sopravvivere su Marte, in riferimento ai valori forniti dal pannello (temperatura, pressione - considerare il concetto di vita in relazione alla presenza di acqua allo stato liquido: se l\u2018acqua esiste in forma liquida, pu\u00f2 (o non pu\u00f2) esistere anche la vita). Spiegare che non sono mai state scoperte forme di vita presenti o tracce di vita passata in nessun pianeta o luna nel Sistema Solare o al di fuori (in esopianeti); tuttavia, milioni di pianeti non sono ancora stati perlustrati dall'uomo. Che tipo di creature potrebbero esistere l\u00ec? Che tipi di protezioni/abilit\u00e0 necessiterebbero avere per sopravvivere? Che aspetto avrebbero? (per esempio, dotati di una spessa pelliccia oppure viventi sottoterra, ecc\u2026) Cosa mangerebbero? Come comunicherebbero l'un con l'altro? (in assenza di aria dove propagarsi, il suono non pu\u00f2 esistere).\n\n###Legenda\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 7** - Creare una legenda che spieghi il significato dei TUOI simboli rappresentati sulla mappa. Si possono raggruppare in base alla natura dei loro processi di formazione (esogeno, come i fenomeni atmosferici ed eolici; endogeno, come quelli vulcanici e tettonici; collisivo, come gli impatti con oggetti nello spazio). Aggiungere il titolo \"LEGENDA\" e spiegare i simboli, indicando l\u2019elemento a cui corrispondono.\n\n**Compito**: chiedere agli studenti di scrivere o disegnare un racconto, utilizzando il paesaggio della mappa come sfondo e le creature come personaggi della storia. Guida alla trama: come ha potuto la superficie diventare come \u00e8 ora? (raccontato con fantasia, non scientificamente).

Sebbene la Terra sia circa 149 milioni di chilometri distante dal Sole, percepiamo l'energia delle esplosioni che avvengono al suo interno. Infatti, tutta la vita sulla Terra dipende dal calore e dalla luce provenienti dal Sole.\n\n####Osservare il Sole\n\nGuardare direttamente il Sole, anche per brevi istanti, \u00e8 una pessima idea perch\u00e9 i nostri occhi sono molto sensibili alla sua luce. Anche nell'oscurit\u00e0, almeno quando c'\u00e8 una minima quantit\u00e0 di luce, i nostri occhi riescono ancora a rilevare cose. Quindi immagina cosa accade quando focalizzi tutta quella luce brillante che proviene dal Sole su una piccola area come l'occhio. I rilevatori di luce nella parte posteriore dell'occhio possono bruciarsi. Sfortunatamente, a differenza di una scottatura sulla pelle, probabilmente il tuo occhio non guarir\u00e0.\n\nSe vuoi una dimostrazione visibile di quanto possa essere dannoso il Sole, guarda il [blog astronomico di Stuart Lowe](http://www.strudel.org.uk/blog/astro/000347.shtml). Nel link \u00e8 presente un video che mostra cosa succede quando un chicco d'uva \u00e8 posizionato all'oculare di un telescopio che punta direttamente il Sole senza filtri. Molto rapidamente il chicco inizier\u00e0 ad annerirsi e bruciare. Un occhio \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 delicato di un chicco d'uva, perci\u00f2 questo video \u00e8 un efficace monito alla cautela da usare nell\u2019osservazione del Sole.\n\n**Pertanto, per favore, per nessun motivo, mai guardare direttamente il Sole.**", "fulldesc": "####Introduzione al Sole\n\nChiedi agli studenti cosa, nello spazio, ci permette di vedere. Dovremmo guardarlo direttamente? \nSe danneggia i nostri occhi (e le fotocamere) guardandolo direttamente, allora come possiamo guardarlo?

(Puoi sperimentare la dimensione del foro, ma circa 3 mm funziona bene.)\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/cf19753b-af2d-4b59-b5c4-f00a24d5bf1b/1409_11.jpg)\n\n####Osservare col visore solare in modo sicuro\n###Passo 12\nRicorda di non guardare il Sole direttamente. Vai fuori e posizionati col Sole alle spalle.

The surface of a sphere is a curved area, but using coordinates like up and down does not make much sense, because the surface of a sphere has neither a beginning nor an ending. Instead, we can use spherical polar coordinates originating from the centre of the sphere, where the radius is fixed by its size (Figure 1). Two angular coordinates remain. Applied to the Earth, they are called the latitude and longitude. Its rotation provides the symmetry axis. The North Pole is defined as the point where the theoretical axis of rotation meets the surface of the sphere, and the rotation is counter-clockwise when looking at the pole from above. The opposite point is the South Pole. The equator is defined as the great circle halfway between the poles.\n\nThe latitudes are circles parallel to the equator. They are counted from 0\u00b0 at the equator to \u00b190\u00b0 at the poles. The longitudes are great circles connecting the two poles of the Earth. For a given position on Earth, the longitude going through the zenith, the point directly above, is called the meridian. This is the line the Sun apparently crosses at local noon. The origin of longitudes is defined as the Prime Meridian, and passes Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory of England is located. From there, longitudes are counted from 0\u00b0 to +180\u00b0 (eastward) and -180\u00b0 (westward). \n\nExample: Heidelberg in Germany is located at 49.4\u00b0 North and 8.7\u00b0 East.\n\n<br/>\n**Elevation of the pole (pole height)**\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/87579d33-91ac-42a1-82aa-9a74238401eb/Live Oak star trails - Flickr.jpg) \n**Figure 2:** Trails of stars at the sky after an exposure time of approximately 2 hours (Credit: Ralph Arvesen, Live Oak star trails, https://www.flickr.com/photos/rarvesen/9494908143, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode)\n\n<br/>\nIf we project the terrestrial coordinate system of latitudes and longitudes on the sky, we get the celestial equatorial coordinate system. The Earth\u2019s equator becomes the celestial equator and the geographical poles are extrapolated to build the celestial poles. If we were to take a photograph with a long exposure of the northern sky, we would see from the trails of the stars that they all revolve about a common point, i.e. the northern celestial pole (Figure 2).\nIn the northern hemisphere, there is a moderately bright star near the celestial pole, namely, the North Star or Polaris. At the southern celestial pole, there is no such star that can be observed with the naked eye. Other methods must be used to find it. If we stood exactly at the geographical North Pole, Polaris would always be directly overhead. We can say that its elevation would be (almost) 90\u00b0. This information already introduces the horizontal coordinate system (Figure 3). \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/87579d33-91ac-42a1-82aa-9a74238401eb/Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.png)\n**Figure 3:** Illustration of the horizontal coordinate system. The observer is the origin of the coordinates assigned as azimuth and altitude or elevation (Credit: TWCarlson, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.svg, \u2018Azimuth-Altitude schematic\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nIt is the natural reference we use every day. We, the observers, are the origin of the coordinate system located on a flat plane whose edge is the horizon. The sky is imagined as the hemisphere above. The angle between an object in the sky and the horizon is the altitude or elevation. The direction within the plane is given as an angle between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, the azimuth, which is usually measured clockwise from north. In navigation, this is also called the \u2018bearing\u2019. The meridian is the line that connects north and south at the horizon and passes the zenith.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/87579d33-91ac-42a1-82aa-9a74238401eb/PoleHeightLatitude_high_low.png)\n**Figure 4:** When combining the three coordinate systems (terrestrial spherical, celestial equatorial and local horizontal), it becomes clear that the latitude of the observer is exactly the elevation of the celestial pole, also known as the \u2018pole height\u2019 (Credit: own work).\n\n<br/>\nFor any other position on Earth, the celestial pole or Polaris would appear at an elevation less than 90\u00b0. At the equator, it would just graze the horizon, i.e. be at an elevation of 0\u00b0. The correlation between the latitude (North Pole = 90\u00b0, equator = 0\u00b0) and the elevation of the celestial poles is no coincidence. Figure 4 combines all three mentioned coordinate systems. For a given observer at any latitude on Earth, the local horizontal coordinate system touches the terrestrial spherical polar coordinate system at a single tangent point. The image demonstrates that the elevation of the celestial north pole, called the pole height, is exactly the northern latitude of the observer on Earth.\n\n<br/>\n**Mean and true solar time**<br/>\nFigure 5 demonstrates the Earth\u2019s rotation and its orbit around the Sun. The Sun illuminates the Earth, which leads to day and night. Within nearly 24 hours, the Earth rotates once around its own axis. As a result, the orientation relative to the sky at position 2 is the same as that at position 1.\n\nIn addition to its own rotation, the Earth also revolves around the Sun. At position 1, the Sun indicates local noon. This means, in the northern hemisphere, the Sun is due south. However, at position 2, i.e. after one full rotation, the Sun does not align with that point in the sky anymore, in that it indicates a time before local noon. In order to have the Sun at the same spot in the sky again (next local noon), the Earth has to revolve and rotate for a little longer (position 3). As a result, a solar day lasts a few minutes longer than it takes the Earth to rotate around its own axis. The solar day takes almost exactly 24 hours.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/87579d33-91ac-42a1-82aa-9a74238401eb/SiderealTime.png)\n**Figure 5:** Illustration of the difference between solar and sidereal day (Credit: Francisco Javier Blanco Gonz\u00e1lez, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tiempo_sid\u00e9reo.en.png, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nHowever, the orbital speed of the Earth around the Sun is not constant throughout the year. It is faster near perihelion and slower near aphelion.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/87579d33-91ac-42a1-82aa-9a74238401eb/Seasons1_MN.png)\n**Figure 6:** Schematic view of the Earth\u2019s elliptical orbit around the Sun throughout a year. The position closest to the Sun is the perihelion, while the most distant point is the aphelion (Credits: following Duoduoduo's advice, vector image: Gothika, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seasons1.svg, \u2018Seasons1\u2019, annotations updated by Markus Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nConsequently, the duration of a true solar day changes constantly. This is reflected by the apparent solar time (AST) or true solar time (TST), which corresponds to the true apparent path of the Sun across the sky. Therefore, 12:00 noon TST is exactly when the Sun is due south.\n\nOn average, the solar day lasts 24 hours, which corresponds to a full apparent revolution of the Sun in the sky, i.e. 360\u00b0. Based on this average, we can also assume that on average every day is equally long, i.e. the Sun returns to the same position exactly every 24 hours. We have seen that in reality this is not the case, but it simplifies measuring time. This timescale is called the mean solar time (MST). This means that the angular speed \u03c9 of the Earth relative to the Sun\u2019s apparent position for a solar day is, on average, 360\u00b0 divided by 24 hours (h), or 15 degrees per hour:\n\n\u03c9 = 360\u00b0/ 24h = 15\u00b0/ h\n\n<br/> \n**Determining longitude** <br/>\nWith this rotational rate, one can determine longitude if both the time at the Prime Meridian and the local time are known. If one calculates the difference between those times, the longitude is derived by simply multiplying this number with 15.\n\n\u0394t = 12h - TST\n\nThe longitude in degrees is then\n\u03bb = \u0394t \u2219 15 \u00b0/ h = (12h - TST) \u2219 15\u00b0/ h\n\n<br/>\n**Glossary**<br/>\n*Aphelion*<br/>\nThe point of the Earth\u2019s orbit that is most distant from the Sun\n\n*Apparent movement*<br/>\nMovement of celestial objects that is in fact caused by the rotation of the Earth\n\n*Cardinal directions*<br/>\nMain directions, i.e. north, south, west, east\n\n*Culmination* <br/>\nPassing of the meridian by celestial objects.

Its value is identical to the latitude of the observer on Earth.\n\n*Precession* <br/>\nAs a spinning body rotates, the rotation axis often also moves in space. This is called \u2018precession\u2019. As a result, the rotation axis constantly changes its orientation and points to different points in space. The full cycle of the precession of the Earth\u2019s axis takes roughly 26,000 years. \n\n*Sextant* <br/>\nNavigational tool invented during the 18th century used to measure the angular altitude of celestial objects to determine latitude\n\n*Spherical polar coordinates* <br/>\nThe natural coordinate system of a flat plane is Cartesian and measures distances in two perpendicular directions (ahead, back, left, right). For a sphere, this is not very useful, because it has neither beginning nor ending. Instead, the fixed point is the centre of the sphere. When projected outside from the central position, any point on the surface of the sphere can be determined by two angles, one of which is related to the symmetry axis. This axis defines two poles. In addition, the radius represents the third dimension in space, whereby each point within a sphere can be determined. This defines the spherical polar coordinates. When defining points on the surface of a sphere, the radius stays constant.\n\n*Time zone* <br/>\nBefore mass transportation across large distances by train became possible, each town had its own local time that followed the solar time. This situation became impractical, as time tables for trains had to consider the shifts in time between stations. Therefore, in the 1840s, a standard time that would be valid throughout Britain was decided on. Later, the concept was implemented all over the world, with 24 zones of local standard times, namely, the time zones. This is what we still use today.\n\n*True solar time (apparent solar time)* <br/>\nThe duration of a true solar day \u2013 the period between two meridian passages of the Sun \u2013 changes throughout the year. This is caused by the eccentric orbit of the Earth around the Sun. While the rotational speed of the Earth itself remains constant, the orbital velocity around the Sun does not. Consequently, a true solar day can be off from the mean value of 24 hours between about 20 to 30 seconds. This leads to differences between the true and mean solar times of up to approximately 15 minutes in either direction. In this time frame, noon is when the Sun is exactly on the meridian, i.e. south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere.\n\n*Zenith* <br/>\nPoint in the sky directly above\n\n\n\n\n\n", "fulldesc": "###**PREPARATIONS**\nThis activity only briefly introduces the concept of deriving latitude from the angular measurements of celestial objects. A more detailed approach is provided by other activities from the educational package focused on celestial navigation called \u2018Navigation Through the Ages\u2019. The teacher might want to have a look at those first.\n\nThere are two versions of a longitude clock available. One is a computer app written in Java, because of which it is independent of the operating system. However, please check whether it runs on your local computers. For details, see the instructions for the app below.\n\nThe other version is a hands-on cardboard dial, similar to a planisphere. The students will have to build it first. The instructions are included.\n\n###**INTRODUCTION**\nIt would be beneficial if the activity were discussed in the larger context of seafaring, e.g. in geography, history and literature.\n\nTip: This activity could be combined with other forms of acquiring knowledge like giving oral presentations in history, literature or geography highlighting navigation. This would prepare the field in a much more interactive way than what a teacher can achieve by summarising the facts. This topic is also well suited for acting classes.\n\nTip: There are good documentaries available highlighting the works of John Harrison and the history of finding the longitude.\n\nThis is a suggested collection:\n\n\u2018Longitude and latitude explained\u2019, Australian National Maritime Museum (Duration: 2:33)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8gg98ws2Eo\n\n\u2018Determine Longitude\u2019, Science Online (Duration 11:10)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7yoXhbOQ3Y\n\n\u2018The Clock That Changed the World (BBC History of the World)\u2019, Leeds Museums (Duration 29:01)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-g27KS0yiY\n\nLet the students watch these during a preparatory lesson or at home.\n\n###**QUESTIONS, ANSWERS AND DISCUSSION**\nAsk the students if they had an idea about how long mankind had been using ships to navigate the oceans. One may point out the spread of Homo sapiens to islands and isolated continents like Australia.\n\nPossible answers:\nWe know for sure that ships have been used to cross large distances since 3,000 BCE or earlier. However, the early settlers of Australia must have found a way to cross the oceans around 50,000 BCE.\n\nAsk the students what the benefits of trying to explore the seas could have been. Perhaps someone knows historic cultures or peoples that were famous sailors. The teacher can support this with a few examples of ancient seafaring peoples, e.g. from the Mediterranean, and the art of navigation.\n\nPossible answers:\nFinding new resources and food, trade, the spirit of exploration and curiosity.\n\nAsk the students how they find their way to school every day. What supports their orientation and prevents them from getting lost? As soon as reference points (buildings, traffic lights, bus stops, etc.) are mentioned, ask them how navigators were able to find their way on the seas. In early times, they used sailing directions in connection to landmarks that could be recognised. But for this, the ships would have to stay close to the coast. Lighthouses improved the situation. But what could be used as reference points in the open sea? The students will probably soon mention celestial objects like the Sun, the Moon and stars. \n\n\n\n*Additional suggested questions and answers* <br/>\nQ: From the documentary, what were the major obstacles for building a marine timekeeper? <br/>\nA: They were too inaccurate and unreliable at sea. The main reasons for this were that the rolling movements of the ships interfering with the pendulums and there were great differences in the temperature and humidity in the open sea.\n\nQ: What triggered the Longitude Act--the call for finding an accurate method to determine longitude? <br/>\nA: The naval disaster of 1707 at the Scilly Islands.\n\nQ: How are time and the rotation of the Earth connected? <br/> \nA: The solar time, as we use it, is connected to the apparent diurnal movement of the Sun. Every two noons are separated by 24 hours during which the Earth rotates (approximately) once around its own axis. The rotation of the Earth apparently moves the Sun around the sky. The longitude above which the Sun shines changes in time.\n\nQ: How long is one day in hours? How many degrees of one rotation are within one hour? <br/>\nA: 1 day = 24 hours; 360 degrees = 1 full rotation; 15 degrees per hour\n\nQ: How would measuring time permit determining longitude? <br/> \nA: The difference in time between the current position on Earth and a longitude reference (the Prime Meridian at Greenwich) is directly proportional to the longitude of an unknown position.\n\nQ: Who solved the longitude problem with a novel clock? <br/> \nA: The clockmaker John Harrison.\n\nQ: What was the clockwork of John Harrison\u2019s H1 clock made of? <br/> \nA: Wood.\n\nQ: What is the main difference in design between H1 and H4? <br/> \nA: The H1 is a large and heavy clock, while the H4 is similar to a pocket watch and is easier to operate.\n\nQ: Where are these clocks displayed now? <br/>\nA: The Greenwich Observatory Museum.\n\nQ: Which great explorer tested and used a copy of the H4 during his voyages around the world? <br/>\nA: James Cook.\n\n*Remark* <br/> \nThe following activity can either be done with a cardboard version of the longitude clock or the computer app. Teachers can choose one. Please check if the app runs on local computers. For details, see the instructions for the app below.\n\n###**BUILDING THE LONGITUDE CLOCK (Available as separate document)**\nItems needed:\n- Template printed on heavy paper or thin cardboard\n- Instructions\n- Crafting knife\n- Scissors\n- Glue\n\nThe template of the longitude clock consists of four pages.\n1.\tPrint the template on extra heavy paper or cardboard to provide stability.\n2.\tCut out the square areas.\n3.\tGlue the squares with the maps back to back.

A printable version is available as a separate file (own work).\n\n###**THE LONGITUDE CLOCK APP**\nThere is a Java application attached to this unit that works in the same way as the longitude clock built by the students. After the software is started, the northern and southern hemispheres appear side by side. The time can be set by dragging with a computer mouse or typing. The software contains a readme file with further instructions.\n\n*Minimum requirements:*\n- Java version 7 or higher\n- Graphic board that supports at least OpenGL 3.3\nWhen the application is started, the OpenGL version that is currently supported will be shown in a separate console.\n\n*Important Remark:* <br/>\nSince the graphical standard mentioned above (OpenGL 3.3) was only introduced in 2010, it is possible that the app will not run on all computers, especially those that are older or only possess a simple graphic card. It is recommended that the teacher test the application beforehand.\n\n*Instructions:* <br/> \nUnzip the file astroedu1646-LongitudeQuest-LongitudeClock.zip anywhere on a computer that has either Windows or Linux installed. A new folder called LongitudeClock is created. Go to this folder and run either the Windows or Linux launcher script. Detailed information about its usage is included.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/87579d33-91ac-42a1-82aa-9a74238401eb/LongitudeClockApp.png)\n**Figure 8:** Screen shot of the longitude clock application.\n\n\n###**ACTIVITY 1: FIND THE LONGITUDE**\nMaterials needed:\n- Worksheet\n- Longitude clock or/and longitude clock application\n- Pencil\n- Calculator\n- Computer, if the longitude clock app is used\n\nStudents will learn the concept of determining the longitude using the longitude clock. Its precision is good enough to illustrate the procedure by visualising the underlying mathematical concept. However, the time resolution is too small to determine the longitude with very high precision as is needed for navigation.\n\nThe worksheets contain a summary of the most important concepts needed to understand and carry out this activity.\n\n*Using the longitude clock* <br/>\nWhen navigating using a sextant and clock, the local time on board a ship is compared to the time measured at the Prime Meridian. For this purpose, ships used to carry along a highly accurate clock that was set to the time at 0\u00b0 longitude, i.e. the time at the Greenwich Observatory. The measurements were usually made at local noon, i.e. when the Sun attains its highest elevation.\n\nThe Prime Meridian is indicated on the longitude clock. To determine longitude, simply turn the marker of the Prime Meridian to the time displayed by the clock, which is set to the time at the 0\u00b0 longitude. The local longitude is then indicated at the time marker of 12 o\u2019clock (local noon). The longitudes are indicated in steps of 15\u00b0 west and east of the Prime Meridian. The teacher may choose to project the longitude clock app and demonstrate its usage to the students.\n\nNote that for our exercises, we assume the clocks are showing the True Solar Time, but we calculate assuming the mean duration of a solar day of 24 hours.\n\n\n*Exercise* <br/>\nThe worksheet contains a table with five examples of time readings (time at the Prime Meridian) for local noon (TST). The students calculate the time difference and the resulting longitude by applying the equations below. The results are then crosschecked with the longitude clock (paper or app version).\n\nIf TST is the true solar time at Greenwich (Prime Meridian), the time difference in hours between local noon and TST is\n\n\u0394t = 12h - TST\n\nThe longitude corresponds to the angle the Earth has rotated between noon at the Prime Meridian and the local noon. Since the mean solar day lasts 24 hours, one hour corresponds to 15\u00b0 in longitude. The local longitude in degrees is then\n\n\u03bb = \u0394t \u2219 15\u00b0/ h = (12h - TST) \u2219 15\u00b0/ h \n\nNegative values indicate western longitudes while positive values represent eastern longitudes.\n\n**Table 1: List of Greenwich times for which the students are asked to calculate the longitudes, if local noon is assumed. The solutions (not provided to the students) are added in italics.** <br/>\n\nTrue Solar Time at Greenwich (hh:mm) | \u0394t (h) | \u03bb (\u00b0)\n--- | --- \n08:00 | +4 | 60 East \n23:00 | -11 | 165 West\n18:00 | -6 | 90 West\n00:00 | +12 | 180 West/ East \n14:30 | -2.5 | 37.5 West\n\n\nIf the students have difficulties applying the equations, the teacher may want to demonstrate the solution for the first example.\n\nNote: The teacher may want to change the focus of the exercise by starting with the longitude clock and using the calculations as a crosscheck instead.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 2: CAPTAIN COOK'S SECOND VOYAGE**\nMaterials needed:\n- Worksheet\n- Pencil\n- Calculator\n- Computer/tablet/smartphone with internet connection\n\nUsing the worksheet, the students follow up on Cook\u2019s second voyage. They determine latitude and longitude of seven locations during the three-year journey and locate each position on an online map.\n\nQ: How many minutes and seconds are in one hour? <br/> \nA: 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds\n\nThe latitude can be calculated on the basis of any observable celestial object. If its position in the sky is known, the angle between the horizon and that object, the elevation, leads to the latitude. Celestial objects have coordinates of their own. It is important to note here the angle towards the equator. This angle is called \u2018declination\u2019 and corresponds to the latitude on Earth. Only at the terrestrial poles, the equator aligns with the horizon.\n\nThe latitude \u03d5 is calculated from the declination \u03b4 and elevation \u03b7 using the following equation.\n\n\u03d5 = \u00b1 (90\u00b0 - \u03b7) + \u03b4\n\nThe plus sign in front of the bracket is chosen if the Sun attains its highest elevation to the south. It is minus if the Sun is to the north. The sign of \u03d5 is positive for northern latitudes and negative for southern latitudes. Unfortunately, the Sun changes its declination all the time. However, it can be calculated. For the seven measurements, its value is added to the table.\n\n*Story* <br/> \nCaptain James Cook began his second voyage on 13 July 1772. His fleet consisted of two ships, the HMS Resolution and the HMS Adventure, the latter commanded by Captain Tobias Furneaux. Before setting sail, Cook took the first set of measurements.\n\nAfter stopping in the Madeira and Cape Verde Islands, the expedition anchored on 30 October 1772 at their first major southern port. They navigated around the Cape of Good Hope and after manoeuvring the ships through pack ice, they reached the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773. Both ships rendezvoused on 17 May 1773. From there, they explored the Pacific, and on 15 August reached an island, where the first pacific islander ever to visit Europe embarked on the HMS Adventure.\n\nThe Adventure returned to England early, while Cook with the Resolution continued to roam the seas. After several attempts to venture south of the Antarctic Circle, he reached the most southern point on 30 January 1774, where ice blocked the passage. Cook continued to explore the Pacific but finally decided to steer a course home. Cook headed east and his crew sighted land on 17 December 1774. They spent Christmas in a bay that Cook later named Christmas Sound.\n\nHe continued exploring the South Atlantic and discovered South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. After a stopover in southern Africa, the ship returned home on 30 July 1775.\n\n**Table 2: List of navigational measurements made on Cook\u2019s flagship HMS Resolution on seven dates during his second voyage. The measurements were all obtained at local noon, i.e. at the highest elevation of the Sun on that day. The times were obtained from the K1 watch James Cook took with him.** <br/>\n\nDate | Solar declination (\u00b0) | Sun direction | Solar elevation (\u00b0) | True Solar Time (hh:mm:ss)\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n13 July 1772 | 21. 7 | South | 61.3 | 12:16:24\n30 October 1772 | -14.1 | North | 70.2 | 10:46:24\n17 May 1773 | 19.3 | North | 29.7 | 00:22:48 \n15 August 1773 | 14.0 | North | 58.5 | 02:01:36\n30 January 1774 | -18.6 | North | 37.4 | 19:07:36 \n17 December 1774 | -23.4 | North | 60.0 | 17:05:14\n30 July 1775 | 18.5 | South | 58.1 | 12:06:00\n\nFor the seven destinations mentioned here, the table above lists measurements from which the students should determine the latitude and the longitude and add them to the table with the results below.\n\nFor the longitudes, use the equations in Activity 1. The times listed in the table have to be converted into hours, with decimals representing the minutes and seconds.\n\n*Example:*<br/>\nThe first measurement is at Cook\u2019s home port. It was taken on 13 July 1772 at 12:16:24. So, it is 12 hours, 16 minutes, and 24 seconds. To convert this into hours with decimals, simply add up the following numbers:\n\n12 hours\n16/60 hours\n24/3600 hours\n\nThe sum is rounded to 12.2733 hours.\n\nFollowing the equation mentioned above, you get (rounded to the first decimal):\n\n\u03bb = (12h - 12.2733h) \u2219 15\u00b0/ h = -4.1\u00b0\n\nThus, the longitude is -4.1\u00b0 or 4.1\u00b0 west.\n\nTo get the latitude, calculate (northern hemisphere, i.e. the Sun is in the south):\n\n\u03d5 = (90\u00b0 - \u03b7) + \u03b4 = (90\u00b0 - 61.3\u00b0) + 21.7\u00b0\n\n**Table 3: A table prepared for the students to fill in the solutions. The results (not provided to the students) are added in italics.**\n\nDate | Latitude (\u00b0) | Longitude (\u00b0) | Location on map\n--- | --- | ---\n13 July 1772 | *50.4 N* | *4.1 W* | *Plymouth*\n30 October 1772 | *33.9 S* | *18.4 E* | *Cape Hope/Table Bay* \n17 May 1773 | *41.0 S* | *174.3 E* | *Queen Charlotte Sound (NZ)* \n15 August 1773 | *17.5 S* | *149.6 E* | *Tahiti* \n30 January 1774 | *71.2 S* | *106.9 W* | *Most southern point, close to Antarctica* \n17 December 1774 | *53.4 S* | *76.3 W* | *West of Patagonia Strait of Magellan*\n30 July 1775 | *50.4 N* | *1.5 W* | *English Channel, close to Isle of Wight*\n\nIf possible, check a map in an atlas or via a map service online where these positions are on Earth. In Google Maps, simply enter the latitude followed by the longitude, both separated by a comma.\n\n###**FINAL DISCUSSION**\nThe students are invited to discuss how accurate this method is. The discussion may be guided along these lines. The answers are suggestions of where the discussion may lead.\n\nQ: Which steps are needed to plot a ship\u2019s position on the open sea? <br/> \nA: Either course and speed or solar elevation at local noon and Greenwich time.\n\nQ: How does weather interfere with this? <br/>\nA: The Sun must be visible for latitude and the time of local noon to be determined. Winds and storms make measurements difficult.\n\nQ: What knowledge and skills are needed to navigate in the way you did? <br/>\nA: Simple math, the meaning of latitude and longitude, measuring angles of celestial objects, etc.\n\nQ: What skills and knowledge are needed to navigate with GPS? <br/> \nA: Very little.\n\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "\n", "conclusion": "This module highlights the navigational challenges in determining longitude from time measurements.

Credit: ESO/MPE/Marc Schartmann\n\n<br/>\nGravity is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe. The force of gravity was first described mathematically by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687. His theory described how objects feeling the force of gravity behaved, but Newton could not explain gravity\u2019s origins. This happened in 1916, when Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity, which described gravity as the result of mass curving space-time around it.\n\nThrough observations made by big telescopes, our understanding of gravity is tested. There are many big telescopes around the world, observing space in all fields of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples include the Very Large Telescope (VLT), ALMA, the Hubble Space telescope and the Lovell radio telescope. The next generation of big telescopes are currently being planned and constructed, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The advantage of big telescopes is that they can detect fainter objects, looking further into space and therefore further back in time. They can also image the sky with a higher resolution, thus improving our view on the universe.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/839c6104-361e-4185-b321-642c45002770/Picture2.jpg)\nThe Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank, part of e-MERLIN. Credit: Howard Barlow\n\n<br/>\nBig telescope observations related to gravity include examining how objects like planets and stars move in space and the way light bends around massive objects like galaxies. This is still an open area of research as there are many mysteries in the universe, such as dark matter, dark energy and some ideas of Einstein. The answers to some of these mysteries may force us to update our current ideas of gravity.", "fulldesc": "###**INTRODUCTION:**\n\nThe lesson plan is presented in three sections: Gravity on Earth, Big Telescopes and Gravity in Space. Depending on the length of lessons in your school, these could be delivered as a single lesson or split into a series of two or three separate lessons.\n\n\n###**PREPARATION:**\n\nDownload all the relevant documents of the lesson plan. Start with the \u2018Gravity PowerPoint Presentation\u2019 and carry out the following three parts (or a specific part) after each section of the presentation.\n\n\n##**PART 1: GRAVITY ON EARTH**\n\nWithin the first section of this lesson/series of lessons, your students will first learn about the classical force of gravity, put forward by Newton. They will learn the difference between \u2018mass\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019, the equation that links the two and investigate the strength of gravity on Earth.\n\nThis investigation can be performed in two ways. The first is to directly measure the acceleration due to gravity, by measuring the acceleration of an object in free fall. The other is to measure the strength of gravity on Earth by taking measurements of masses hanging from Newton meters.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/839c6104-361e-4185-b321-642c45002770/Picture3.jpg)\n\n<br/> \n**Option 1: Free fall (Data logging)**<br/>\nThe strength of gravity is also defined as the \u2018acceleration due to gravity\u2019. It is possible to directly measure the strength of gravity by measuring the acceleration of an object as it drops to the ground. For an experiment of this nature, we recommend a group size of three or four.\n \nIf you choose to run a free fall experiment, you may need to consider the following:\n- We recommend the following equipment set-up for this experiment: data logging equipment, using two light gates (option A below). However, it is also possible to work with a single light gate and a stopwatch (option B below).\n- Light gates are pieces of hardware. The data logging can be done with an additional piece of hardware (a data logger), or a piece of software running on a computer (to which the light gates are connected).\n- The author recommends uLog as a relatively economical and straightforward option to use, though many more are available. uLog light gates can be connected to a laptop or PC via USB, and they come with easy-to-use software.\n- Your light gate(s) will need to be mounted onto a clamp stand. Most light gates come with an attachment to do this.\n- Choose suitable objects to drop: smaller, denser objects work best as they are less affected by air resistance. Also, the objects will likely need to be a regular shape, e.g. a square. Please check what your data logging software recommends.\n- The data logging software will help your students to collect a high number of results. However, many of these results may be highly inaccurate, e.g. if the dropped object only falls through one light gate and misses the second, or falls at an awkward angle. To enable students to record successful and unsuccessful readings, we have provided a Data validity worksheet. By referring to this sheet for analysing their results, students can ignore their unsuccessful readings from the calculation of the average.\n- It may be possible to demonstrate that acceleration due to gravity is independent of the weight of the object being dropped (i.e. heavy objects do not fall quicker than light objects). This depends on students collecting good quality results in terms of accuracy. Provide students with a variety of objects of different weights, but similar sizes (exactly the same size if possible). For example, small blocks made out of wood or metal. However, ensure that the lightest objects are not light enough to be affected by air resistance. There should not be a correlation between weight and acceleration.\n\nDepending on the equipment available in your school, it is possible to run a free fall experiment with one or two light gates. See more information on these options below.\n\n**A.\tUsing data logging equipment with two connected light gates:** <br/>\n\n|Equipment needed |\n|--- |\n|Computer/laptop running data logging software |\n|A pair of connected light gates |\n|Clamp stand |\n|Regular shaped object to drop |\n\n- The easiest way to complete a free fall experiment is with data logging equipment that uses two connected light gates.\n- Attach the light gates to your clamp stand, one above the other.\n- Drop an object through the light gates, making sure the object breaks the beams of both light gates. Most data logging software will directly calculate the acceleration of the object, provided the size of the object and the distance between the light gates are known.\n- Please refer to your data logging software instructions on how to do this.\n- Students can then copy their results to an Excel spreadsheet, where they can delete unsuccessful readings and/or anomalous data before calculating the average.\n\n**B.\tUsing data logging equipment with a single light gate**\n\nIf you do not have access to connected pairs of light gates, another option is to use a single light gate and a stopwatch.\n\n| Equipment needed |\n| --- |\n| Computer/laptop running data logging software\n| A light gate |\n| Clamp stand |\n| Stopwatch |\n|Regular shaped object to drop |\n\n- Attach your light gate to a clamp stand.\n- Drop an object from a suitable height above the light gate. Use the stopwatch, and time how long it takes from the start of the drop to the object passing through the light gate. The height of the drop does not need to be known.\n- The light gate should be used to take a measurement of the final speed of the object. Most data logging software will directly calculate the speed, provided the size of the object is known. The acceleration can then be calculated from the equation acceleration = (final speed - initial speed) \u00f7 time. Since the initial speed = zero (provided the object is dropped, not thrown), this simplifies to acceleration = final speed \u00f7 time.\n- Students could enter their results into an Excel spreadsheet that calculates the acceleration for them, using this equation. Students can also delete unsuccessful readings and/or anomalous data before calculating their average.\n\nIf you do not have access to the required data logging equipment for the above, students could also measure the acceleration due to gravity by measuring, using a Newton meter, the amount of downward force (weight) on masses of different sizes.\n\n<br/>\n**Option 2: Newton meters** <br/>\nIf light gates and data loggers are not available to you, students can measure the strength of gravity on Earth by taking measurements from masses hanging from Newton metres.\n\n| Equipment needed |\n| --- |\n| Newton metre |\n| Variety of masses |\n\nBy hanging different masses from Newton meters and reading off the weight, it is possible to calculate the strength of gravity in N/Kg, from the equation strength of gravity = weight \u00f7 mass. Students may get a variety of readings from different Newton meters. They may also get different readings if the masses attached are too low to stretch the spring, or if they are so large that they overstretch the spring. This will give students the opportunity to identify anomalous results and calculate a class average. For a Newton meter experiment, we recommend a group size of two.\n\n\n###**PART 2: BIG TELESCOPES**\nIn the second section of the lesson, students are briefly introduced to some of the big telescopes around the world (and in space). They are also presented with some of the astronomical questions relating to gravity that are still being investigated by astronomers.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/839c6104-361e-4185-b321-642c45002770/Picture4.jpg) \nBird\u2019s Eye View of the Very Large Telescope. Credit: J.L. Dauvergne & G. H\u00fcdepohl (atacamaphoto.com)/ESO\n\n\n###**PART 3: GRAVITY IN SPACE**\nIn the final section, students consider how gravity acts in space. They use a 3D model of gravity, similar to the model of general relativity put forward by Einstein, to better imagine the force of gravity and its effects.\n\n**Method**\n\n| Equipment needed |\n| --- |\n| Hula hoop |\n| Approx. 1m<sup>2</sup> (depends on size of hula hoop) of stretchy lycra material |\n| Bulldog clips |\n| Weights of different sizes and masses |\n| Small balls (e.g. marbles) |\n\n- Cut a section of stretchy lycra material so that it can be stretched taut over a hula hoop and secure it with bulldog clips or safety pins around the edge. This is now a 2D representation of spacetime, as developed by Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity.\n- Hold up the hula hoop above the ground and place a mass on the lycra surface. A suitably heavy mass (e.g. 100 g to 500 g) will sink into the lycra, creating a curved surface around it.\n- The mass represents a star or planet in space, and the curved lycra represents the gravity field around it. By rolling small balls (like marbles) around the weight, you will see that they follow a curved path \u2013 they are orbiting!\n\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/839c6104-361e-4185-b321-642c45002770/Picture5.jpg)\nPart 3 being demonstrated. Credit: Howard Barlow\n\n<br/>\nStudents should draw an analogy between the stretched lycra and an object\u2019s gravity extending outwards into space and gradually getting weaker as the distance increases. This will hopefully work towards dispelling the misconception that gravity is binary, i.e. that it is \u2018on\u2019 at the surface of the Earth and \u2018off\u2019 when in space.\nThis model actually represents the curved \u2018spacetime\u2019 of Einstein's theory of general relativity, published in 1916. In this theory, Einstein proposed that mass bends the spacetime around it, curving and stretching space and time (as opposed to the perfectly flat space in classical physics). Objects, e.g. planets or particles or rays of light, travelling near massive objects such as stars and other planets follow the curvature of space, so their path bends around these objects. We perceive this change of direction as the force of gravity pulling them.\nFor this activity, we recommend a group size of three or four. An excellent (if very large scale!) demonstration of this activity can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg.\n\n<br/>\n**Examples of things to try:**<br/>\nThese are listed on slide 25 of the accompanying PowerPoint, but more information is given below.\n1.\tPlace a second weight onto the lycra. The two weights will be attracted together, if they come too close to one another.\n2.\tExperiment with the strength of the \u2018gravity fields\u2019 around weights of different masses.\n3.\tTry to get a planet (a smaller, lighter ball such as a marble) to orbit around a star (a larger, heavier weight):\na)\tBy rolling the planet around the star. It\u2019s possible to get one or two good orbits, but not many more. The planet will lose energy quickly and start spiralling into the star because of the friction of the fabric (there is no friction in space, so this does not occur).\nb)\tBy applying small rotations. First, apply a bit of pressure to the star to hold it in place. Now those holding the hula hoop can rotate it in small circles. This will provide the force necessary to overcome the friction of the lycra and cause the planet to roll around (in real space there is no friction, so no constant driving force is required). The gravity of the star will constrain the planet and keep it in orbit. If the driving force is too strong, the planet will overcome gravity and fly off out into space.\n4.\tTry to get a planet to orbit two stars in the shape of the figure eight (you may have to hold the stars in place to stop them attracting together). Many stars exist in binary systems. The figure of eight also represents the path the Apollo missions took to get to and from the Moon. \n5.\tConsider the similarities and differences between this model and real life (for higher-achieving students). This model excellently demonstrates the pull of gravity in one plane; however, in reality gravity acts in three dimensions.

The surface of a sphere is a curved area, and using directions like up and down is not useful, because the surface of a sphere has neither a beginning nor an ending. Instead, we can use spherical polar coordinates originating from the centre of the sphere, which has a fixed radius (Figure 1). Two angular coordinates remain, which for the Earth are called the latitude and the longitude. The axis of rotation is also the symmetry axis. The North Pole is defined as the point where the theoretical axis of rotation coincides with the surface of the sphere, and the Earth rotates in a counter-clockwise direction when the pole is viewed from above. The opposite point is the South Pole. The equator is defined as the great circle halfway between the poles.\n\nThe latitudes are circles parallel to the equator. They are counted from 0\u00b0 at the equator to \u00b190\u00b0 at the poles. The longitudes are great circles connecting the two poles of the Earth. For a given position on Earth, the longitude going through the zenith, which is the point directly above, is called the meridian. This is the line that the Sun apparently crosses at local noon. The origin of this coordinate is defined as the meridian of Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory of England is located. From there, longitudes are counted from 0\u00b0 to \u00b1180\u00b0.\n\nExample: Heidelberg in Germany is located at 49.4\u00b0 North and 8.7\u00b0 East.\n\n<br/>\n**Elevation of the pole (pole height)** <br/>\nIf we project the terrestrial coordinate system of latitudes and longitudes in the sky, we get the celestial equatorial coordinate system. The Earth\u2019s equator becomes the celestial equator and the geographical poles are extrapolated to build the celestial poles. If we were to take a photograph of the northern sky with a long exposure, we would see from the trails of the stars that they all revolve about a common point, which is the northern celestial pole (Figure 2).\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, there is a moderately bright star near the celestial pole, which is the North Star or Polaris. It is the brightest star in the Little Bear constellation, or Ursa Minor (Figure 3). In the present era, Polaris is less than a degree off. However, 1000 years ago, it was 8\u00b0 away from the pole. Therefore, today, we can use it as a proxy for the position of the celestial north pole. At the southern celestial pole, there is no such star that can be observed with the naked eye. Other procedures have to be applied to find it.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Live Oak star trails - Flickr.jpg)\n**Figure 2:** Trails of stars at the sky after an exposure time of approximately 2 hours (Credit: Ralph Arvesen, Live Oak star trails, https://www.flickr.com/photos/rarvesen/9494908143, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode)\n\n<br/> \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Ursa_Major_-_Ursa_Minor_-_Polaris_Cr4Y2eG.jpg)\n**Figure 3:** Configuration of the two constellations Ursa Major (Great Bear) and Ursa Minor (Little Bear) in the northern sky.

We can say that its elevation would be (almost) 90\u00b0. This information introduces the horizontal coordinate system (Figure 4), which is a natural reference we use every day. We, the observers, are the origin of that coordinate system located on a flat plane, whose edge is the horizon. The sky is imagined as a hemisphere above. The angle between an object in the sky and the horizon is the altitude or elevation. The direction within the plane is given as an angle between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, the azimuth, which is usually measured clockwise from the north. In navigation, this is also called the bearing. The meridian is the line that connects north and south at the horizon and passes the zenith.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.png)\n**Figure 4:** Illustration of the horizontal coordinate system. The observer is the origin of the coordinates assigned as the azimuth and altitude or elevation (Credit: TWCarlson, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.svg, \u2018Azimuth-Altitude schematic\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nFor any other position on Earth, the celestial pole or Polaris would appear at an elevation less than 90\u00b0. At the equator, it would just appear at the horizon, i.e. at an elevation of 0\u00b0. The correlation between the latitude (North Pole = 90\u00b0, Equator = 0\u00b0) and the elevation of Polaris is no coincidence. Figure 5 combines all three mentioned coordinate systems. For a given observer at any latitude on Earth, the local horizontal coordinate system touches the terrestrial spherical polar coordinate system at a single tangent point. The sketch demonstrates that the elevation of the celestial north pole, also called the pole height, is exactly the northern latitude of the observer on Earth.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/PoleHeightLatitude_high_low.png)\n**Figure 5:** When the three coordinate systems (terrestrial spherical, celestial equatorial and local horizontal) are combined, it becomes clear that the latitude of the observer is exactly the elevation of the celestial pole, also known as the pole height (Credit: M. Nielbock, own work).\n\n<br/>\nFrom this, we can conclude that if we measure the elevation of Polaris, we can determine our latitude on Earth with reasonable precision.\n\n<br/>\n**Triangles and trigonometry** <br/>\nThe concept of the kamal relies on the relations within triangles. These are very simple geometric constructs that the ancient Greeks worked with. One basic rule is that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0 or \u03c0. This depends on whether the angles are measured in degrees or radians. One radian is defined as the angle that is subtended by an arc whose length is the same as the radius of the underlying circle. A full circle measures 360\u00b0 or 2\u03c0.\n\nThe sides of a triangle and its angles are connected via trigonometric functions, e.g. sine, cosine and tangent. The easiest relations can be seen in right-angled triangles, where one of the angles is 90\u00b0 or \u03c0/2.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Picture6.png)\n**Figure 6:** A right-angled triangle with \u03b3 being the right angle (Credit: Dmitry Fomin, CC0).\n\n<br/>\nThe hypotenuse is the side of a triangle opposite the right angle. In Figure 6, it is c. The other sides are called legs or catheti. The leg opposite to a given angle is called the opposite leg, while the other is the adjacent leg. In a right-angled triangle, the relations between the legs and hypotenuse are expressed as trigonometric functions of the angles.\n\nsin \u03b1 = a/c = opposing leg / hypotenuse     (Equation 1)\n\n\ncos \u03b1 = b/c = adjacent leg / hypotenuse     (Equation 2)\n\n\ntan \u03b1 = (sin \u03b1) / (cos \u03b1) = a/b = opposing leg / adjacent leg     (Equation 3)\n\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem tells us something about the relations between the three legs of a right-angled triangle. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras and states that the sum of the squares of the catheti is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.\n\nc<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>     (Equation 4)\n\n\nFor general triangles, this expands to the law of cosines.\n\nc<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab \u2219 cos \u03b3     (Equation 5)\n\n\nFor \u03b3=90\u00b0, it reduces to the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n<br/> \n**Early navigation** <br/>\nEarly seafaring peoples often navigated along coastlines before sophisticated navigational skills were developed and tools were invented. Sailing directions helped to identify coastal landmarks (Hertel, 1990). To some extent, their knowledge about winds and currents helped them to cross short distances, e.g. in the Mediterranean.\n\nSoon, navigators realised that celestial objects, especially stars, can be used to maintain the course of a ship. Such skills have been mentioned in early literature like Homer\u2019s Odyssey, which is believed to date back to the 8th century BCE. There are accounts of ancient Phoenicians who were able to even leave the Mediterranean and ventured on voyages to the British coast and even several hundred miles south along the African coast (Johnson & Nurminen, 2009). A very notable and well-documented long-distance voyage has been mentioned by ancient authors and scholars like Strabo, Pliny and Diodorus of Sicily. It is the voyage of Pytheas, a Greek astronomer, geographer and explorer from Marseille who, around 300 BCE, apparently left the Mediterranean by passing Gibraltar and carried on north until the British Isles and beyond the Arctic Circle, where he possibly reached Iceland or the Faroe Islands, which he called Thule (Baker & Baker, 1997). Pytheas used a gnomon or sundial, which allowed him to determine his latitude and measure the time during his voyage (Nansen, 1911).\n \t\n<br/>\n**Sailing along a latitude** <br/>\nAt these times, the technique of sailing along a parallel (of the equator) or latitude was based on observing circumpolar stars. The concept of latitudes in the sense of angular distances from the equator was probably not known. However, it was soon realised that when looking at the night sky, some stars within a certain radius around the celestial poles never set; these are circumpolar stars. When sailing north or south, sailors observe that the celestial pole changes, too, and with it, the circumpolar radius. Therefore, whenever navigators see the same star culminating, i.e. transiting the meridian, at the same elevation, they stay on the \u2018latitude\u2019.  For them, it was sufficient to realise the connection between the elevation of stars and their course. Navigators had navigational documents that listed seaports together with the elevation of known stars. In order to reach the port, they simply sailed north or south until they reached the corresponding latitude and then continued west or east.\n\nNowadays, the easiest way to determine one\u2019s latitude on Earth is to measure the elevation of the North Star, Polaris, as a proxy for the true celestial North Pole. In our era, Polaris is less than a degree off. However, 1000 years ago, it was 8\u00b0 away from the pole.\n\n<br/>\n**The kamal** <br/>\nThe kamal is a navigational tool invented by Arabian sailors in the 9th century CE (McGrail, 2001). Its purpose is to measure stellar elevations without the notion of angles. If you stretch out your arm, one finger subtends an angle. This method appears to have been the earliest technique to determine the elevation of stars. In the Arabian world, this \u2018height\u2019 is called isba (\u0625\u0635\u0628\u0639), which simply means finger. The corresponding angle is 1\u00b036\u2018 (Malh\u00e3o Pereira, 2003).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Simple_Wooden_Kamal.jpg)\n**Figure 7:** A simple wooden kamal. It consists of a surveying board and a cord with a line of knots (Credit: Bordwall https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_Wooden_Kamal_(Navigation).jpg, \u2018Simple Wooden Kamal (Navigation)\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nThis method was standardised by using a wooden plate, originally sized roughly 5 cm \u00d7 2.5 cm, with a cord attached to its centre. When held at various distances, the kamal subtends different angles between the horizon and the stars (Figure 8). Knots located at different positions along the cord denote the elevations of stars and, consequently, the latitude of various ports.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/8.png)\n**Figure 8:** Illustration of how the kamal was used to measure the elevation of a star, in this case, Polaris. The lower edge was aligned to the horizon. Then, the distance between the eyes and the kamal was modified until the upper edge touched the star. The distance was set by knots tied into the cord that was held between the mouth and the kamal. The knots indicate the elevations of stars (Credit: M. Nielbock, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kamal_Polaris.png, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kamal_Polaris_Side.png, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nWhen Vasco da Gama set out to find the sea passage from Europe to India in 1497, he stopped at the Eastern African port of Melinde (now, Malindi), where the local Muslim Sheikh provided him with a skilled navigator of the Indian Ocean to guide him to the shores of India. This navigator used a kamal for finding the sailing directions (Launer, 2009).\n\nSince the latitudes the Arabian sailors crossed during their passages through the Arabian and Indian Seas are rather small, the mentioned size of the kamal is sufficient. For higher latitudes, the board must be bigger so that the cord is not too short to realise such angles.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Cantino_planisphere_cropped.jpg)\n**Figure 9:** Excerpt of a world map from 1502 showing the Indian Ocean. All sea routes from the Arabian Peninsula and India lie between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator. The port of Melinde is indicated at the third flag from the top at the eastern African coast (Credit: Cantino Planisphere, 1502, Biblioteca Estense Universitaria, Modena, Italy, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg, public domain).\n\n<br/>\n**The geometry of the kamal** <br/>\nTo measure an angle \u03c6 with a kamal of height h, the distance between the eyes and the board held perpendicularly to the line of sight needed is l. This is realised by a knot in the cord on the side opposite to the kamal board. In this simple configuration, we get:\n\nl = h' / tan\u2061\u03c6' = h / (2\u2219 tan\u2061(\u03c6/2) )     (Equation 6)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/10.png)\n**Figure 10:** Simplified geometry of the kamal, which subtends an angle \u03c6 between the horizon and Polaris. The kamal has a height labelled h. The length of the cord between the eyes and the kamal is labelled l (Credit: M. Nielbock, own work).\n\n<br/>\nHowever, the length is measured with the cord between the teeth or just in front of the lips. The eyes and mouth are separated by the length d (Figure 11). The true length of the cord is then l, while l' is the distance between the eyes and the kamal board that defines the angle \u03c6. This more realistic approach leads to the following equation:<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Equation 7.png)    (Equation 7)\n\nWe see that for d=0, we again get the simplified version above. The difference between l and l' can be a few centimetres. A realistic value is d=7 cm.\n\nThis geometry is accurate enough for uncertainties inherent to the measurement method. Note that it is always assumed that the kamal board is held at an angle perpendicular to the line of sight, not the cord. In addition, the horizon is assumed to be the mathematical one (Figure 5). This means that the dip of the visible horizon is neglected.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/11.png)\n**Figure 11:** More realistic geometry of the kamal considering the difference in distance between the kamal on one side and the mouth and the eyes on the other.

However, the early settlers in Australia must have found a way to cross the oceans around 50,000 BCE.\n\n\nAsk the students what the benefits of trying to explore the seas could have been. Perhaps, someone knows historic cultures or peoples that were famous sailors. The teacher can support this with a few examples of ancient seafaring peoples, e.g. from the Mediterranean.\n\nPossible answers:\nFinding new resources and food, trade, the spirit of exploration and curiosity.\n\n\nAsk the students how they find their way to school every day. What supports their orientation so they don\u2019t get lost? As soon as reference points (buildings, traffic lights, bus stops, etc.) have been mentioned, ask the students how navigators were able to find their way on the seas. In early times, people used sailing directions in connection to recognisable landmarks. But for this, the ships would have to stay close to the coast. Lighthouses improved the situation. Magnetic compasses have been a rather late invention, around the 11th century CE, and they were not used in Europe before the 13th century. So what could be used as reference points in the open sea? Probably the students will soon mention celestial objects like the Sun, the Moon and stars.\n\nTell the story of the kamal and Vasco da Gama, the discoverer of the direct passage from Europe to India.

An instruction manual is available separately.\n\nMaterial needed:\n- one piece of ply wood (preferred) or very stiff -\n card board (21 cm \u00d7 12 cm \u00d7 4 mm)\n- 50 cm of cord\n- Pencil\n- Ruler\n- Saw (for the wood) or scissors (for the cardboard), if the board has to be cut to fit the size needed\n- Drill (for the wood) or thick needle (for the cardboard)\n\nThe kamal was originally conceived as a navigational tool for low latitudes. Therefore, its size was relatively small, i.e. a few centimetres. This was enough to measure angles of 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 degrees above the horizon. For example, for a kamal of height 5 cm, a cord length of 20 cm yields an elevation measure of 15\u00b0. However, this relation is not linear. Therefore, for higher latitudes, a larger kamal board is needed. A good compromise is a height of 21 cm, while the width can be 12 cm. With these dimensions, the following relations hold. For very low latitudes, the kamal can be rotated by 90\u00b0, and the smaller width permits smaller cord lengths to reach the same angles.\n\n**Table 1: Dimensions and relations between the angles and lengths of a kamal according to Eq. (7). The distance between the eyes and the mouth is assumed to be d=7 cm.** <br/>\n\nAngle subtended (\u00b0) | Board height (cm)| Cord length (cm)| Board width (cm)| Cord length (cm) \n--- | --- | --- | ---\n30 | 21 | 41.6 | **12** | **25.1**\n35 | 21 | 36.0 | **12** | **22.2**\n40 | 21 | 31.9 | **12** | **20.0**\n45 | **21** | **28.8** | 12 | 18.3\n50 | **21** | **26.3** | 12 | 17.0\n55 | **21** | **24.2** | 12 | 16.0 \n60 | **21** | **22.5** | 12 | 15.2 \n65 | **21** | **21.1** | 12 | 14.4 \n70 | **21** | **19.9** | 12 | 13.8\n\nFor each kamal, prepare a thin piece of ply wood (approx. 4 mm) of size 21 cm \u00d7 12 cm. If this is not available, a piece of very stiff cardboard of equal size can also be used. Determine the centre of the board by drawing or scratching two diagonal lines that connect opposite corners. Drill a hole through the centre that is big enough to permit the cord to fit through. It must also be small enough not to let it slide out again after a knot is tied.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1b3023a5-78d5-41ac-82e3-3f7cabef9f0c/Kamal building template 2.png)\n**Figure 12:** The kamal after running the cord through the central hole (Credit: M.

The knot should block the cord from sliding through the hole.\n\nNow add knots at distances from the board as indicated in Table 1. Be careful to keep the cord straight. You can restrict the number of knots according to the angular range needed for the activities. Remember that the elevation of Polaris corresponds to the latitude.\n\nFill out the table on the worksheet that lists the number of knots and the corresponding angles.\n\n\n###**ACTIVITY: ANGELS IN THE SKY **\n**Introduction** <br/>\nThe worksheets contain Figure 2 (star trails). There are a few questions to be asked that can help students understand the concept of the apparent trajectories of stars.\n\nQ: What does this picture show, in particular, where do the bright curved lines come from? <br/>\nA: As the Earth rotates, the stars seem to revolve around a common point. This is the celestial pole. The long exposure enables visualisation of the path of the stars as trails.\n\nQ: How does the picture show us that some stars do not set or rise during a full day? <br/> \nA: Many trails can be followed to form a full circle. One rotation is 24 hours.\n\nQ: Can you identify the star that is next to the celestial North Pole? In this picture, it should be close to the centre of rotation. <br/> \nA: This is Polaris or the North Star. It is the star that produces the smallest trail close to the centre of the trails.\n\nQ: Imagine you are at the terrestrial North Pole. Where would Polaris be in the sky? Where would it be if you stood at the equator? <br/> \nA: North Pole: zenith, i.e. directly above\n     Equator: at the northern horizon\n\n\n**Preparations** <br/>\nFind a spot outside with a good view of the northern sky and the horizon. This activity can be done as soon as the North Star is visible. Therefore, the summer time may not the best season for this activity.\n\n\n**Finding Polaris** <br/> \nFinding Polaris in the sky is rather simple. As soon as the stars are visible, let the students look at them for a while and ask them if they knew the group of stars that is often called the Big Dipper. Its name is different in different cultures (Ladle, Great Chariot, Plough, Drinking Gourd). It is easy to find in the northern hemisphere as it is always above the horizon. A video explains this in detail.\n\nFind North with the Stars - Polaris & Ursa Major - Celestial Navigation (Duration: 11:04)\nhttps://youtu.be/n_gT9nBfhfo\nFigure 3 also shows how Polaris can be found using the Big Dipper (also available as individual images). It is present in the worksheet. Find the box of the stellar group and the two stars at the front (\u03b1,\u03b2). Extend the line between them five times and find a moderately bright star. This is Polaris, the North Star.\n\n\n**Measuring the elevation of Polaris** <br/>\nNow the students use the kamal. The cord must be kept straight during the measurements. The board must be held with the smaller edges up and down and perpendicular to the line of sight. Any tilt would compromise the measurement.\n\nAs shown in Figure 8 (provided in the worksheet), the lower edge of the kamal must be aligned with the horizon. Then, the length of the cord is modified until the upper edge touches the star. The alignment with the horizon and the star should be checked again.\n\nThe students count the number of knots needed to keep the kamal aligned. Counting starts with the knot closest to the board. They may have to interpolate the position between knots. They write down the number and read the corresponding angle from the list in their worksheet. They will have determined the latitude.\n\nThe values of the various individuals and groups may differ. \n\nQ: Why are the results not always identical? <br/> \nA: Some aspects are not perfect (especially knot positions), and different kamal sizes change the perspective a bit. Further, the kamal may not always be held correctly.\n\nQ: How would this affect real navigation on open seas? <br/> \nA: Small errors of a few degrees can lead to course deviations. One degree in latitude corresponds to 60 nautical miles. Repeated measurements and additional information can mitigate this effect.\n\n\n**Analysis** <br/>\nThis can be done as homework and checked during the next lesson in school. Let the students check their results with a local map that provides coordinates or online services like Google Maps or Google Earth.\n\nIn Google Earth, you can right-click on your location and then click on \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d. A small window appears at the bottom of the screen and lists two numbers. The first is the latitude in degrees with decimals. This number is added to the worksheet.\n\nThe students may realise that the result differs from their own measurement. Let them write down the underlying reasons.\n\nDuring the next lesson, let them discuss their results.\n\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "The kamal is a navigational tool that was invented by Arab navigators and has been used for many centuries since. This activity uses the example of the kamal to demonstrate how navigation at sea can be successful with some knowledge about astronomy and the stars combined with simple tools. The students learn some major aspects of the history of navigation by applying the basics of maths and astronomy. They build their own kamal and learn how to use it to determine their latitude on Earth by using Polaris as the resting reference point in the sky.

Non \u00e8 un\u2019introduzione alle strutture del Sistema Solare o all\u2019Astronomia.\nL\u2019Astronomia \u00e8 una disciplina totalmente diversa dalla scienza planetaria. \nI soggetti studiati dalla Planetologia sono i pianeti e un campo importante di questa \u00e8 costituito dall\u2019*astrogeologia*, che studia la geologia della superficie dei pianeti e delle lune. Questa \u00e8 un'attivit\u00e0 astrogeologica e cartografica. \nL\u2019Astronomia si interessa, per esempio, di stelle, galassie e del moto dei pianeti.\n\n**Difficolt\u00e0 della cartografia**: le mappe mostrano i corpi celesti secondo la proiezione di Lambert (che propone due separati punti di vista degli emisferi. Questo richiede una spiegazione aggiuntiva dell\u2019insegnante su come sia possibile proiettare due \u2018lati\u2019 di una stessa sfera su due vedute circolari, che non equivale a osservare due corpi celesti differenti).\n\n**Astrobiologia**: si occupa delle creature \u2018aliene\u2019; sulla mappa, ogni caratteristica morfologica \u00e8 reale ed \u00e8 collocata nella sua posizione effettiva; tuttavia, le creature viventi sono immaginarie e, perci\u00f2, anche in questo caso \u00e8 necessaria la spiegazione dell\u2019insegnante cos\u00ec che gli studenti non credano che esseri umani o \u2018alieni\u2019 vivano su pianeti o lune. \nDeve essere chiarito che nessun segno di vita passata o presente \u00e8 stato mai evidenziato su pianeti o lune al di fuori della Terra. \nQuesta potrebbe essere una buona occasione per parlare dei miliardi di esopianeti esistenti nell\u2019Universo che, a differenza della maggior parte dei pianeti extra-terrestri e delle lune nel nostro Sistema Solare, includono milioni di pianeti e lune in cui le condizioni sono molto pi\u00f9 favorevoli alla vita. \nUn nuovo, entusiasmante ambito della scienza planetaria \u00e8 l\u2019esoplanetologia, che si occupa dei pianeti al di fuori del Sistema Solare. Molti di quegli esopianeti ed esolune sono totalmente diversi da quelli del nostro sistema planetario. \nIl principio base delle missioni spaziali \u00e8 la ricerca della vita. Su Marte, gli scienziati sono alla ricerca di regioni in cui potrebbe essersi sviluppata vita in passato o ripari geologici in cui avrebbe potuto sopravvivere (all\u2019interno di caverne, nel sottosuolo, tra le rocce, negli strati della superficie contenenti acqua, ecc\u2026). Questo \u00e8 il motivo per il quale la NASA stava ricercando prove della presenza di acqua. Ora che sono state identificate sia le zone che le diverse unit\u00e0 geologiche contenenti acqua (sotto forma di ghiaccio), stanno perlustrando il pianeta per trovare segni di vita presente o passata. Europa potrebbe avere un oceano al di sotto della sua superficie, che si espone allo spazio in corrispondenza delle fratture del terreno. Gli scienziati, oggi, sono alla ricerca di forme di vita che si sviluppino a partire dagli stessi elementi da cui si generarono quelle terrestri, cio\u00e8 viata basata sul carbonio, che dipende dall\u2018acqua; per questo stanno cercando aree dove l\u2019acqua possa eistere nello stato liquido.\nPotrebbe esistere anche forme di vita diverse, ma, non avendo conoscenze a riguardo e non sapendo come identificarle, l\u2019obiettivo primario \u00e8 di individuare quelle basate sul carbonio.\n\n**Programmi spaziali**: oltre alla ricerca della vita e di corpi celesti o di zone che siano ospitali per creature simil-terrestri, i programmi spaziali sono motivati dalla competizione tra le nazioni. L'esplorazione spaziale favorisce la comprensione dei processi geologici attivi nel nostro pianeta e quelli del suo passato e futuro. Per esempio, l\u2019intenso effetto serra su Venere pu\u00f2 aiutare a prevedere la manifestazione di processi simili sulla Terra, oppure dai crateri da impatto si pu\u00f2 individuare l\u2019aspetto che aveva la Terra 4 miliardi di anni fa.\nUno dei risultati inaspettati raggiunti dal programma Apollo, che invi\u00f2 uomini sulla Luna, fu il cosiddetto l\u2019 \u2018overview effect\u2019 (la \u2018veduta d\u2019insieme\u2019): questa fu la prima volta - e, finora, l\u2019unica - in cui l\u2019occhio umano vide il nostro pianeta come una fragile \u2018biglia blu\u2019 che si staglia sullo spazio oscuro; ci\u00f2 ha cambiato la nostra percezione del mondo e della nostra posizione nell\u2019universo.\n\n**Ricerca spaziale**: gli scienziati possono intraprendere ricerche individuali su una singola struttura morfologica per anni, tentando di spiegare come e quando si \u00e8 formata; altri ricostruiscono regioni specifiche in dettaglio e classificano le caratteristiche raffigurate sulle mappe. Dopo la pubblicazione dei risultati della ricerca, essa diventa un piccolo mattoncino per la costruzione del grande edificio che \u00e8 la scienza planetaria e altri scienziati possono usufruirne al fine di migliorare i loro modelli evolutivi della superficie planetaria oppure usarli nelle proprie ricerche.\nGran parte dei contenuti presenti in queste mappe sono stati ottenuti negli ultimi decenni e, in alcuni casi, solo da pochi anni. L\u2019origine di alcune strutture morfologiche non \u00e8 stata ancora completamente chiarita.\n\n###Descrizione generale dei parametri che potrebbero essere discussi per descrivere il pianeta o la luna scelti.\n\n**Tipo di corpo celeste**: Pianeta o luna. I pianeti orbitano intorno al Sole, mentre le Lune orbitano intorno ad un pianeta. Generalmente, una luna rivolge sempre la stessa faccia verso il suo pianeta (rotazione sincrona).\n**Composizione**: i corpi celesti rocciosi sono fatti di silicati (ad esempio, la Terra); quelli ghiacciati sono composti da una mescolanza di ghiaccio e roccia, ma le superfici sono per lo pi\u00f9 di ghiaccio (ad esempio, Europa). Su questi pianeti le montagne e le pianure non sono altro che ghiaccio solido. I pianeti si trovano solo nelle regioni pi\u00f9 fredde del Sistema Solare esterno.     \n**Atmosfera**: l\u2019atmosfera \u00e8 presente solo nel caso in cui la gravit\u00e0 (e le dimensioni) del corpo celeste sia sufficientemente forte da attrarre le molecole di gas, non permettendo loro di sfuggire nello spazio. \u00c8 pi\u00f9 facile mantenere vicine le molecole se sono fredde.\n**Elementi allo stato liquido**: gli elementi che si trovano allo stato liquido possono essere l\u2019acqua nelle regioni pi\u00f9 interne del Sistema Solare, o metano, etano ed azoto nelle regioni pi\u00f9 esterne. Lo stato liquido \u00e8 presente soltanto dove c'\u00e8 un'atmosfera, che esercita una pressione sulla superficie; se la pressione atmosferica \u00e8 troppo bassa, i liquidi evaporano o sublimano; se la temperatura \u00e8 troppo alta, i liquidi congelano, mentre se \u00e8 troppo elevata evaporano. L\u2019acqua potrebbe esistere nel sottosuolo.\n**Clima**: escursione termica diurna (oscillazione della temperatura tra il giorno e la notte) e fenomeni di precipitazione.\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: caratteristiche generate da forze interne al pianeta. Il fenomeno del **vulcanesimo**, per manifestarsi, richiede la presenza di strati fusi all'interno del corpo celeste. Il calore \u00e8 prodotto dal processo di formazione del pianeta (calore da impatto o da aggregazione di particelle) oppure dal processo irreversibile di decadimento radioattivo degli elementi.\nI corpi celesti pi\u00f9 piccoli si raffreddano pi\u00f9 velocemente di quelli grandi; per questo, il vulcanesimo si verifica solo nei pianeti di maggiori dimensioni o, eccezionalmente, nel caso in cui l\u2019interno del corpo celeste fosse permanentemente riscaldato. Ci\u00f2 accade per le lune su orbite ellittiche, dove le forze di marea producono calore endogeno (per esempio, Io). Le strutture caratteristiche di origine **tettonica** sono generate dalla tensione nella crosta pi\u00f9 friabile: le fratture sono provocate da forze tettoniche durante i terremoti, i quali richiedono la presenza di moti interni del corpo celeste, causati dal suo calore endogeno. I vulcani si sviluppano in altitudine con l\u2019accumularsi di lava verso l\u2019alto; tuttavia, essi possono collassare su s\u00e9 stessi, dando origine e caldere simili a crateri.\n**Caratteristiche esogene**: strutture prodotte dai processi che si verificano sulla superficie del pianeta o nella sua atmosfera, tra le quali si includono quelle di natura eolica (venti), fluviale (fiumi), lacustre (laghi), oceanica e i lori depositi.\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: strutture generate da collisioni con altri corpi (piccoli crateri e grandi bacini da impatto). I crateri pi\u00f9 giovani presentano raggi lineari che si sviluppano in senso radiale, prodotti dai materiali espulsi durante la loro formazione.\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: le strutture pi\u00f9 comuni sono i crateri, gran parte dei quali si \u00e8 formata poco dopo la nascita del Sistema Solare quando molti corpi piccoli si trovavano nello spazio. E\u2019 raro trovare crateri sulle superfici di recente origine, perch\u00e9 la formazione di nuovo terreno ricopre i crateri presenti, seppellendoli. I processi sedimentari che producono una nuova superficie includono la formazione di pianure vulcaniche, le erosioni e sedimenti fluviali e la subduzione delle placche tettoniche.\n**Caratteristiche peculiari/rare:** le strutture che si trovano esclusivamente su quel corpo celeste possono essere generate da specifiche condizioni atmosferiche o climatiche, oppure essere i residui di un evento inusuale verificatosi in passato.\n**Condizioni che rendono difficile lo sviluppo della vita**: la vita dovrebbe essere in grado di crescere e riprodursi; la sua evoluzione potrebbe essere impedita dalle temperature eccessivamente basse (sotto il punto di congelamento) o eccessivamente alte (sopra il punto di ebollizione), dall\u2019assenza di atmosfera, di acqua o di magnetosfera (che protegge i corpi celesti dal danno delle radiazioni emesse dai venti solari). \n**Nomenclatura**: i nomi dei luoghi possono essere proposti dagli scienziati che studiano la regione o la struttura morfologica presa in esame e vengono approvati dal gruppo di lavoro dell\u2019Unione Astronomica Internazionale specializzato nella nomenclatura astronomica. Ogni tipo di struttura geologica e ogni corpo celeste hanno un tema specifico (per esempio, gli dei del fuoco per Io), mentre i termini generici (come \u2018montagna\u2019) sono indicati in lingua latina per assicurare la neutralit\u00e0 di linguaggio. Ci\u00f2 rispetta anche le tradizioni geografiche del 1600, quando le prime mappe delle lune venivano create in Europa, usando nomi in lingua latina.\n**Et\u00e0**: per et\u00e0 del pianeta si indica quella della sua superficie; la presenza di numerosi crateri sulla superficie indica un\u2019et\u00e0 di formazione pi\u00f9 antica (4 miliardi di anni fa), mentre una minore quantit\u00e0 di crateri suggerisce che la superficie abbia un\u2019origine pi\u00f9 recente (da 0 a 3 miliardi di anni fa). Appena dopo la nascita del Sistema Solare (circa 4 miliardi di anni fa), c\u2019erano numerosi oggetti di piccole dimensioni che potevano impattare sui corpi celesti, generando crateri. Col passare del tempo, il loro numero \u00e8 diminuito sempre pi\u00f9, per le avvenute collisioni con i pianeti o perch\u00e9 furono allontanati dal sistema planetario dal loro campo gravitazionale.\n\n**Forme delle strutture geologiche**: \n**Circolare**: generalmente un cratere da impatto e occasionalmente una caldera di natura vulcanica.\n**Lineare (diritta)**: depressioni (fratture tettoniche) o altopiani (dune, dorsali, montagne).\n**Sinuosa**: fiumi o canali di lava.\nLobato: crateri da impatto ricchi d\u2019acqua, materiali piroclastici (detriti espulsi da un cratere o un vulcano), ghiacciai, frane.\n**Radiale**: raggi che si propagano da crateri da impatto.\n**Concentrica**: margine anulare di un cratere.\n\nConfronto con le caratteristiche della Terra: (per fruire del planetario terrestre, utilizzare http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html oppure Google Map)\n\n**Tipo di corpo celeste**: pianeta\n**Composizione**: rocciosa\n**Atmosfera**: presente\n**Elementi allo stato liquido**: acqua\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: vulcani, faglie. Le placche tettoniche sono caratteristiche esclusive della Terra.\n**Caratteristiche esogene**: fiumi, laghi, dune, pianure alluvionali, foci a delta, ghiacciai. Le strutture morfologiche glaciali, sulla Terra, non sono permanenti; infatti, per molti periodi non sono presenti calotte glaciali.\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: si rilevano pi\u00f9 di 100 crateri da impatto, molti dei quali sono stati ricoperti, erosi, o distrutti dalla subduzione delle placche tettoniche, oppure danneggiati dall\u2019acqua.\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: oceani, montagne, pianure, fiumi\n**Caratteristiche rare**: ghiacciai\n**Condizioni che limitano la presenza di vita**: dove il clima \u00e8 troppo secco (dove non esiste acqua allo stato liquido, come nei deserti) o troppo freddo (anche qui senza acqua liquida, come in Antartide)\n**Et\u00e0**: per la gran parte molto giovane, con regioni pi\u00f9 antiche, datate 1 miliardo di anni fa.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/356491c3-1cde-42b6-acae-8a7cb26bfe16/olympus.jpg)\nSize comparison of the highest mountains on Earth and Olympus Mons on Mars\nConfronto tra le dimensioni delle pi\u00f9 alte montagne terrestri e il Monte Olimpo marziano.\n", "fulldesc": "L\u2019insegnante si deve dotare della mappa di Venere in forma stampata, di dimensioni tali da essere leggibile e fruibile dagli studenti, oppure in forma digitale, proiettata ad alta risoluzione.\n\nA questo punto, si possono scegliere uno o pi\u00f9 tra i seguenti sottoargomenti proposti per un\u2019attivit\u00e0 svolta in classe, con o senza le dispense, oppure si possono seguire direttamente le dispense sulle quali sono esplicate le istruzioni per svolgere le attivit\u00e0.\n\nLeggere la prima pagina delle dispense con gli studenti, chiedendo loro di sottolineare tutti i termini che non conoscono, per poterglieli successivamente spiegare.\n\n###CARTOGRAFIA\n\nMostrare la mappa alla classe e chiedere agli studenti perch\u00e9 la raffigurazione del corpo celeste \u00e8 circolare (per esempio, perch\u00e9 il pianeta \u00e8 sferico).

Quale regione o formazione geologica vale la pena esplorare in dettaglio? Perch\u00e9? Cosa vorrebbero analizzare? Di quali strumenti/attrezzi/metodi si servirebbero per l\u2019investigazione? Cosa porterebbero con s\u00e9 per agevolare la ricerca?\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 3** - Il tuo punto di sbarco. Dove sbarcheresti? Quale regione credi sia pi\u00f9 emozionante esplorare? Trova il TUO punto di sbarco. Indicalo con un simbolo. Dagli un nome. Scrivine il nome accanto al simbolo corrispondente.\n\n###TOPONOMASTICA\nChiedere agli studenti di leggere ad alta voce un nome sulla mappa e di spiegare cosa possono supporre da questo, cosa suggerisce loro il nome. I nomi sono in Latino dato che i pianeti non appartengono a nessuna nazione e il Latino \u00e8 considerato un linguaggio neutrale, con valenza internazionale. Chiedere agli studenti se piace questa nomenclatura \u2018neutrale\u2019 (in Latino) oppure se preferirebbero che si utilizzasse l\u2019Inglese (o la propria lingua d\u2019origine). Si possono spiegare i significati dei nomi sulla mappa. I corrispondenti nomi inglesi si trovano nel seguente sito: http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 4** - Nomenclatura. Dopo aver completato la parte grafica, ideare la nomenclatura: scrivere i nomi accanto alle strutture geologiche corrispondenti che avete disegnato. Scrivere tre nomi sulla mappa (se ne possono aggiungere altri in seguito). Si possono utilizzare diversi colori e lettere a seconda del tipo di elemento da definire (per esempio, lettere maiuscole per i continenti, il colore rosso per i canali di lava, ecc\u2026 - sii coerente e costante).\n\n###ASTRONOMIA, CLIMATOLOGIA, METEOROLOGIA\nChiedere agli studenti se \u00e8 presente l\u2019atmosfera sul pianeta ed il perch\u00e9 della loro risposta. \n\nTrovare informazioni sul clima (le temperature superficiali massime e minime) sul pannello della mappa o sulle dispense. Non confondere le coordinate (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, ecc\u2026) indicate sulla mappa con le temperature indicate sul pannello.\n\nChiedere agli studenti se, sul pianeta, \u00e8 presente acqua, oppure altri materiali allo stato liquido, e come lo possono supporre. Confrontare l'intervallo delle temperature locali con la temperatura dell'acqua (la massima, quando bolle, e la minima, quando congela). Qual \u00e8 la probabilit\u00e0 di trovare acqua allo stato liquido?\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 5** - Previsioni del tempo per \u201cdomani\u201d, basandosi sulle informazioni climatiche presenti sulle dispense. Scegliere almeno tre luoghi e indicarne i dati climatici: indicare la temperatura massima e la minima nella propria scala di misura (Celsius o Fahrenheit), scrivendo i valori in GRANDE. Considerare che in prossimit\u00e0 dei poli le temperature risultano pi\u00f9 basse. Accanto ai valori numerici, indicare il tempo meteorologico con un simbolo grafico di propria ideazione: sereno (soleggiato), nuvoloso, piovoso, nebbioso, o altre condizioni climatiche interessanti che si ricavano dalle dispense. I dati relativi alle temperature minime e massime si trovano sul pannello di controllo della mappa, mentre altre informazioni aggiuntive sono sulle dispense.\n\nChiedere agli studenti di quali indumenti di protezione avrebbero bisogno se dovessero esplorare la superficie del pianeta lontano dai loro veicoli, basandosi sui valori che sono stati discussi in precedenza. Per esempio, potrebbero aver bisogno di bombole di ossigeno, di abiti che possano mantenere la temperatura e la pressione ambientale, ecc\u2026\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 6** - Ideare una bandiera per Venere e raffigurarla sulla mappa, basandosi sulle caratteristiche del pianeta (clima, colori, geologia, ecc\u2026).\n\nChiedere agli studenti se le creature, piante o animali potrebbero sopravvivere su Venere, usando i valori forniti dal pannello (temperatura, pressione - considerare il concetto di vita in relazione alla presenza di acqua allo stato liquido: se l\u2018acqua pu\u00f2 essere presente in forma liquida, anche la vita pu\u00f2 (ma potrebbe anche non) esistere). Spiegare che non sono mai state scoperte forme di vita presenti o tracce di vita passata in nessun pianeta o luna nel Sistema Solare o al di fuori (in esopianeti); tuttavia, milioni di pianeti non sono ancora stati esplorati dall\u2019uomo. Che tipo di creature potrebbero esistere su Venere? Che tipo di protezioni/abilit\u00e0 dovrebbero avere per sopravvivere? Che aspetto avrebbero? (per esempio, dotati di una spessa pelliccia oppure viventi sottoterra, ecc\u2026)  Cosa mangerebbero? Come comunicherebbero l\u2019un con l\u2019altro? (in assenza di aria dove propagarsi, il suono non pu\u00f2 esistere).\n\n###LEGENDA\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 7** - Disengna la legenda che spieghi il significato dei TUOI simboli rappresentati sulla mappa.\n\nSi possono raggruppare in base alla natura dei loro processi di formazione (esogeno, come i fenomeni atmosferici ed eolici; endogeno, come quelli vulcanici e tettonici; collisivo, come gli impatti con oggetti nello spazio).\nAggiungere il titolo \u201cLEGENDA\u201d e spiegare i simboli, indicando l\u2019elemento a cui corrispondono.\n\n**Compito a casa**: chiedere agli studenti di scrivere o disegnare un racconto, utilizzando il paesaggio della mappa come sfondo per la storia e le creature come personaggi.  Una possibile trama: come ha potuto la superficie diventare come \u00e8 ora? (raccontato con fantasia, non scientificamente). La storia si pu\u00f2 anche illustrare.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "Le mappe dei vari corpi celesti e i testi allegati sono stati tradotti in 11 lingue diverse, cos\u00ec che gli insegnanti possano fruire di materiali nelle seguenti lingue:\nFrancese, http://cartespourenfants.wordpress.com/ \nInglese, https://childrensmaps.wordpress.com/ \nItaliano, http://mappeperbambini.wordpress.com/ \nPolacco, https://mapydladzieci.wordpress.com/ \nPortoghese, http://mapasparacriancas.wordpress.com/ \nRom\u00e0ni http://mapileshavorenge.wordpress.com/ \nRomeno, http://hartipentrucopii.wordpress.com/ \nRusso, http://kartydlyadetey.wordpress.com/ \nSpagnolo, http://mapasparaninos.wordpress.com/\nTedesco, http://kartenfuerkinder.wordpress.com/ \nUngherese, http://gyerekterkep.wordpress.com/ \n\nAl momento, la mappa di Plutone \u00e8 offerta solo in inglese.\n\nLetture di approfondimento:\nHargitai H. , Gede M. , Zimbelman J., K\u0151szeghy C., Sir\u00e1ly D., Marinangeli L., Barata T., L\u00f3pez I., Szak\u00e1cs A., D\u0119bniak K., Feuillet T., 2015.

This avoids confusion with short-term variations as shown in Figure 1.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/Month_4_2017_plot_3_branded.jpg)\n**Figure 1:** Monthly global mean and European mean surface air temperature anomalies relative to 1981\u20132010, from January 1979 to April 2017.

In many regions on Earth, these changes can be rather large. In order to have a representative temperature value for a single day, the mean value or the average of the recorded values is calculated. The daily mean temperature changes from day to day, because of seasonal influences.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/TempDaily_Jena_1981-2010.png)\n**Figure 2:** Temperature variations in the daily high, daily average and daily low temperatures (own work, based on data provided with this activity).\n\n<br/>\nIn addition, the Earth can be divided into climate zones, which have different ranges of temperatures and precipitation. These zones are produced by large-scale atmospheric interactions or geological features. Besides the previously mentioned temporal average, climate zones are defined via regional averages, which are coarsely aligned with the latitudes, mainly because of the variation of the incident angle of solar irradiation depending on latitude. Various schemes explain climate zones, but in general, there are four or five distinct zones:\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/TempYearly_Jena_1981-2010.png)\n**Figure 3:** Seasonal variation in the daily mean temperature (own work, based on data provided with this activity).\n\n<br/>\n*Tropical zone (between latitudes 0\u00b0 and 23.5\u00b0)*\n- little seasonal variation in insolation\n- very warm throughout the year\n- humid, high precipitation\n\n*Subtropics (between latitudes 23.5\u00b0 and 40\u00b0)*\n- most intense insolation during the summer\n- generally rather dry, little precipitation\n- strong variation in temperatures between day and night (little protective cloud cover)\n- rather cool and moist winters\n\n*Temperate zone (between latitudes 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0)*\n- low incident angle of insolation\n- lower mean temperatures than those in the subtropics\n- seasons and length of day differ through the year\n- precipitation evenly distributed through the year, no or rare arid periods\n\n*Cold zone (between latitudes 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0)*\n- very low incident angle of insolation\n- strong seasonal differences, little diurnal variation\n- low temperatures\n- amount of precipitation depends on geographical conditions\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/Koppen_World_Map_(retouched_versi_qHXCTfT.png)\n**Figure 4:** Detailed climatic zone map of the Earth showing five major climate zones (World_Koppen_Map.png: Peel, M.

A climate chart is a graphical representation of the two main observables that characterise weather and climate: temperature and precipitation. The chart shows one representative value for either of the two quantities for each month. The temperature is the mean temperature in a given month, while the sum for the month is displayed for the precipitation.\n\nCalculating the mean or average of a list of values is the simplest method to determine a representative number. While the individual numbers vary, the mean value tells us what number we can expect on average, provided the boundary conditions that govern its manifestation stay the same.\n\nThe example for Rome, Italy, is given below. The chart is based on the following list of values, which represent the long-term average of temperature and precipitation for each month.\n\n**Table 1: Long-term values of climatic data for Rome.** \n\nMonth | Temperature (\u00b0C) | Precipitation (mm)\n --- | --- \n January | 6.9 | 76\n February | 7.7 | 88\n March | 10.8 | 77\n April | 13.9 | 72 \n May | 18.1 | 63\n June | 22.1 | 48\n July | 24.7 | 14 \n August | 24.5 | 22\n September | 21.1 | 70\n October | 16.4 | 128\n November | 11.7 | 116 \n December | 8.5 | 106\n\nThe resulting climate chart according to Walter and Lieth is given as follows:\n\nThe header of the chart for Rome lists some basic information about the location. Very often, it mentions the annual mean temperature and the summed precipitation amount throughout the year. The chart itself has two scales: the red one to the left displays the temperature in degrees Celsius and the blue one to the right provides the precipitation (rainfall) in millimetres. For very high values of precipitation, the scale above 100 mm is condensed to steps of 100 mm (not in this example). The horizontal scale at the bottom lists the months through the year, abbreviated with the first letter of its name.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/ClimateChart_Rome.png)\n**Figure 5:** Climate chart for Rome, Italy. It illustrates the monthly mean temperatures and the corresponding monthly total precipitation throughout the year (own work based on Geoklima 2.1, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode)\n\n<br/>\nThe red curve depicts the evolution of temperature, averaged for a given month, as listed in the table above. The blue curve shows the evolution of precipitation as the sum calculated for a given month. The values are also listed in the table. The red scale belongs to the red curve and the blue scale, to the blue curve.\n\nIn order to be able to derive climatic information from such a chart, the two scales must be adjusted so that 10\u00b0C corresponds to 20 mm of precipitation, both aligned to zero. With this strategy, humid periods are those where the curve of precipitation is above the temperature curve. In contrast, arid periods are whenever the temperature curve is above the one representing precipitation. Usually, these periods are indicated by colouring the areas between the two curves. Blue upright lines depict humid periods, while a dotted pattern or a filled yellow area represents arid periods. If the scale for precipitation above 100 mm is compacted, the area above this value is generally indicated by a filled blue area (not in this example).\n\n<br/>\n**Averaging, simple mean** <br/>\nAn average value is defined as a number that is the minimum of the sum of differences between the average and the individual values. In an ideal world, this sum of differences is zero.\n\nIf T stands for a given value of a temperature measurement, we can indicate a series of measurements by adding an index, e.g. T1, T2 and T3, which corresponds to the first, second and third values, respectively. In order to calculate the average of a series of measurements, one has to calculate the sum of the individual values and divide it by the number of measurements. With three temperature measurements, the average would be calculated as follows:\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/First equation.png)\n\nOr in general\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/General equation.png)\n \nT \u0305  is the symbol for the temperature average, and n is any given positive integer that corresponds to the number of measurements.\n", "fulldesc": "###**PREPARATIONS**\nIf you choose to let the students work on computers, make sure that spreadsheet software compatible with MS Excel is installed and that the Excel file supplied with this activity is provided to them. Distribute the worksheets. They contain background information about how to construct and to interpret a climate chart.\n\n###**INTRODUCTION: DISCUSSION**\nStart a discussion about the different components of weather that we can measure. Students may come to the conclusion that temperature, wind and rainfall are the main contributors.\n\nAn additional discussion can be conducted on the following questions and topics.\n\nQ: If you knew the current temperature and amount of rainfall, would you be able to determine the season of the year? If the students need help, remind them of the seasons. <br/>\nA: The summer is warmer than the winter in many places on Earth, but there are also cool days during summer and rather warm days during spring. Additionally, the amount of rainfall can change considerably between consecutive days.\n\nQ: What does it mean when we say that generally, summer is warmer than winter? <br/>\nA: Correct answers would be \u2018most of the time\u2019, \u2018on typical days\u2019 or \u2018on average\u2019.\n\nQ: With this in mind, how would you characterise seasons in terms of weather phenomena?<br/>\nA: Seasons characterise periods during the year that on average are associated with a certain kind of weather.\n\nQ: Can you describe different types of climate? What are the climatic differences between \u2026 and \u2026 (select any two regions with very different climates, e.g. southern Spain and London)?<br/>\nA: London is rather rainy and mild, while southern Spain tends to be dry and warm.\n\nQ: If London is characterised as being \u2018rainy\u2019, does it mean that it rains every day?<br/>\nA: No.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 1: THE AVERAGE WEATHER**\nThe students will now characterise the climatic conditions of a specific location, the Observatory of Jena (Jena is pronounced: [`je:na] or in English: yena) in Germany. In the end, they need a list of representative temperatures and precipitations for each month of the year. These values will be 30-year averages of individual weather data obtained for each day.\n\nTable 2 provides daily mean temperatures and accumulated precipitation (rain) for June 2010. Ask the students the following question:\n\nQ: What would be the typical temperature of that month in 2010? How would you calculate it?<br/>\nA: The mean temperature is the average of all temperature measurements.\n\n**Task 1:**<br/>\nLet the students calculate the mean temperature and the total amount of precipitation from this. This table is also available as the \u2018Task 1\u2019 sheet in the Excel spreadsheet file provided. Choose whether the students should calculate the values manually using a pocket calculator or by means of the spreadsheet functions AVERAGE() and SUM(). The result will be added to the corresponding empty cells in Table 3 and the Excel sheet \u2018Task 2\u2019 for the year 2010. More information is given in the worksheet.\n\n**Table 2: Weather data obtained at the Jena Observatory from June 2010, including daily mean temperatures and accu-mulated precipitation.**\n\nDay | Temperature (\u00b0C) | Precipitation (mm) \n--- | --- \n1 | 11.2 | 5.2 \n2 | 12.3 | 1.9 \n3 | 17.3 | 0\n4 | 16.3 | 0 \n5 | 19.1 | 0 \n6 | 22.1 | 0.3 \n7 | 19.5 | 0.3 \n8 | 20.2 | 0 \n9 | 23.7 | 0.1 \n10 | 24.1 | 0\n11 | 22.6 | 1.2 \n12 | 17.7 | 1.2 \n13 | 15.5 | 0\n14 | 15.3 | 0 \n15 | 16.2 | 0 \n16 | 15.4 | 0\n17 | 17.4 | 0 \n18 | 17.5 | 0 \n19 | 13.3 | 0.1 \n20 | 13.5 | 0 \n21 | 13.0 | 0 \n22 | 14.6 | 0\n23 | 16.8 | 0 \n24 | 19.7 | 0 \n25 | 20.1 | 0\n26 | 19.5 | 0\n27 | 19.6 | 0\n28 | 21.4 | 0 \n29 | 22.9 | 0\n30 | 23.2 | 0 \n\n*Expected results:*\nThe mean temperature is 18\u00b0C and the total amount of precipitation is 10 mm.\n\n<br/>\nAfter completing this step, the students will now have to calculate the representative average weather data for June any years between 1981 and 2010. Table 3 lists the monthly average of the temperature and the monthly precipitation for the month of June between 1981 and 2010. Ask the students the following questions:\n\nQ: How can you judge whether the result from the previous task is representative of any June? <br/>\nA: Compare it with the values of other years.\n\nQ: What are the highest and lowest values of the temperature and precipitation?<br/>\nA: Lowest: 14.9\u00b0C, 10 mm; highest: 20.4\u00b0C, 118 mm\n\nQ: What would be the typical temperature in June in any given year? How would you calculate it?<br/>\nA: The long-term mean temperature, i.e. the average of temperature measurements over many years, e.g. 30 years.\n\n**Task 2:**<br/>\nLet the students calculate the mean temperature and precipitation from Table 3. This table is also available as the \u2019Task 2\u2019 sheet in the Excel spreadsheet provided. Choose whether the students should calculate the values manually using a pocket calculator or software. The result will be added to the corresponding empty cells in Table 4 and the Excel sheet \u2018Task 3\u2019 for the month of June.\n\n**Table 3: Averaged weather data for the month of June obtained at the Jena Observatory from 1981 until 2010, including monthly mean values of temperature and monthly precipitation.**\n\nYear| Temperature (\u00b0C) | Precipitation (mm) \n--- | --- \n1981 | 17.2 | 62 \n1982 | 17.9 | 48 \n1983 | 17.4 | 66\n1984 | 15.3 | 89 \n1985 | 14.9 | 60 \n1986 | 16.6 | 62 \n1987 | 15.4 | 104 \n1988 | 16.4 | 57\n1989 | 16.6 | 57\n1990 | 16.8 | 118\n1991 | 15.3 | 80\n1992 | 18.4 | 39\n1993 | 16.9 | 87\n1994 | 17.7 | 73 \n1995 | 15.4 | 75 \n1996 | 16.6 | 34\n1997 | 16.9 | 50 \n1998 | 18.0 | 62 \n1999 | 16.3 | 67 \n2000 | 18.4 | 37 \n2001 | 15.5 | 61\n2002 | 18.4 | 45\n2003 | 20.4 | 55 \n2004 | 16.5 | 46 \n2005 | 17.1 | 39\n2006 | 17.7 | 39\n2007 | 19.0 | 73\n2008 | 18.3 | 43 \n2009 | 15.6 | 56\n2010 |  |  \n\n*Expected results:* The mean temperature is 17\u00b0C and the mean precipitation is 60 mm.\n\n**Table 4: Climate data based on weather data obtained at the Jena Observatory and averaged over 30 years.**\n\nMonth | Temperature (\u00b0C) | Precipitation (mm)\n --- | --- \n January | 2.1 | 35\n February | 2.2 | 34\n March | 5.5 | 46\n April | 9.4 | 45\n May | 14.2 | 60\n June |  | \n July | 19.2 | 77\n August | 18.5 | 65\n September | 14.3 | 48\n October | 10.0 | 38\n November | 5.3 | 53\n December | 2.4 | 46\n\n**Task 3:**<br/>\nFrom Table 4, let the students calculate the annual mean temperature and annual total precipita-tion. This table is also available as the \u2018Task 3\u2019 sheet in the Excel spreadsheet provided. Choose whether the students should calculate the values manually using a pocket calculator or the spread-sheet functions average and sum. The results are typically mentioned in the header of the climate chart to be produced during the next activity.\n\n*Expected results:*<br/>\nThe annual mean temperature is 10\u00b0C and the annual total precipitation is 607 mm.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 2: CLIMATE CHARTS**\nClimate charts are a useful tool to quickly grasp the basic climatic conditions for any given location. Introduce the principles of producing such a chart using the background information. The details are also available in the worksheet. The example of Rome (Table 1) is used to evaluate the student\u2019s basic understanding of the concept. In addition, show Figure 5, which is the climate chart for Rome.\n\n**Task 1:**<br/>\nLet the students discuss the main features of the climate chart. This should be conducted along the following questions:\n- What do the blue and red curves represent?\n- Which are the months with the lowest and highest temperatures?\n- What are the seasons connected with those temperatures?\n- On which hemisphere do we experience summer/winter during these months?\n- Which are the months with the lowest/highest precipitation?\n- When does the blue curve (precipitation) fall below the red curve (temperature)?\n- What does this mean for the climatic conditions? When throughout the year is it humid or dry in Rome?\n\n*Expected results:*<br/>\nThe red and blue curves represent the long-term average annual evolutions of temperature and precipitation, respectively. The lowest and highest temperatures are achieved in January and July, respectively. This means that January represents winter, while July is in the summer. From this, one can deduce that Rome is in the northern hemisphere. The highest and lowest precipitation can be expected in October and July, respectively. Since precipitation is the lowest during the hottest month, and the blue curve is below the red one from June until August, we can expect dry summers. With the wet autumn and winter months, Rome has a climate that is between the moderate climate of central Europe and the dry climate one experiences in Northern Africa. This is typical of a Mediterranean climate.\n\n**Task 2:**<br/>\nBased on the results from the previous activity summarised in Table 4, let the students create a climate chart for the Jena Observatory. The instructions from the worksheet are as follows:\n- Take the millimetre paper and draw the coordinate system for the climate chart. Use the one for Rome as a template. Make sure to leave some room for the header.\n- Make sure the scales reflect the values. \n- The scale for the precipitation must show values that are twice the numbers in the temperature scale in the opposite axis.\n- Add a header that lists the following items: name of the city and country, altitude, latitude, longitude, annual mean temperature and annual total precipitation\n- Begin with the temperature: add a red dot for each temperature value in the twelve months.\n- Connect the dots with a smooth red line.\n- Do the same for the precipitation but use blue. Here, the dots should be connected with straight lines.\n- If the blue line is above the red line, fill the area in between with blue vertical lines.\n- If the blue line is below the red line, colour this area yellow.\n\nDetails of the weather station:<br/>\nName: Jena Observatory (Germany)<br/>\nLatitude: 50.9251\u00b0 N<br/>\nLongitude: 11.583\u00b0 E<br/>\nAltitude: 155 m<br/>\n\n*Expected results:*\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/4e92b666-a99b-4bf0-b310-8aec2f0f9925/ClimateChart_Jena_1981-2010.png) \n\nDiscuss the results like you did for the Rome example. Ask the students how the climate of Jena compares to Rome.\n\nFrom this chart, we can conclude that\n1.\tJena is in the Northern hemisphere as it is warmest in July, and this is similar to Rome.\n2.\tJena has a temperate climate. The precipitation roughly follows the temperature evolution. This is the opposite of the climate in Rome, where it is driest and hottest in the summer.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 3: DERIVE YOUR LOCAL CLIMATE CHART (for advanced students only)**\nWeather data are available for almost any location and area around the world. Use the links below to find the suitable weather station from which you can derive the climate data that are needed to construct your local climate chart.\n\n**USA:**<br/>\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/normals <br/>\nThis tool permits easy access to 30-year averages between 1981 and 2010 for 9,800 weather stations in the USA. On this page, select \u2018Monthly Normals\u2019 and choose from the menu of federal states below. From the newly generates list, select the station that is nearest to your location. This produces a graph and a table. Remember that you need both temperature and precipitation data, which are not always available for all the stations.\n\nClicking on \u2018View Station Details\u2019 provides information needed for the header of the climate chart.\n\nFrom the table, note the values for precipitation and average temperature. They have to be con-verted from inches into millimetres and from \u00b0F into \u00b0C. This can, for example, be done at\nhttps://www.metric-conversions.org\n\n\n**UK:**<br/>\nhttp://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate-historic/#?tab=climateHistoric <br/>\nThis page provides access to historic and current weather data for about 35 weather stations across the UK. It also provides instructions on how to load the data into MS Excel for subsequent statistical analysis.\n\nSelect the red dot that is nearest to your location. A window appears with the name of the station and its geographical coordinates. Click on \u2018Historic station data\u2019 to access the weather data. The linked file is a simple text file that has details on the weather station and lists the weather data averaged for every month of a given year. Among them is \u2018rain\u2019 in millimetres and the mean of the daily minimum and maximum temperatures. To get the mean temperature, just calculate the average of the two values. Then proceed as in Activity 2.\n\n\n**Germany:**<br/>\nftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/ <br/>\nFor details, please refer to the Readme file provided in the FTP folder.\n\nThe suitable data are located at <br/>\nftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate/monthly/kl/historical/ <br/>\n\nThe file \u2018KL_Monatswerte_Beschreibung_Stationen.txt\u2019 lists the station id (needed to identify the data file), the duration of weather observations, altitude in metres, geographical coordinates, the station name and the federal state of each of the weather stations. The data are stored in the files labelled monatswerte_XXXXX_YYYYYYYY_ZZZZZZZZ_hist.zip.\n\nHere, XXXXX is the station id, while YYYYYYYY and ZZZZZZZZ denote the temporal range of the data. Select the station with sufficient temporal coverage nearest to your location. The content of these files is explained in DESCRIPTION_...pdf at the top of the file list.\n\nFrom the ZIP file, extract the file \u2018produkt_monat_Monatswerte\u2026txt\u2019. From this file, you need the columns\n\nMESS_DATUM_BEGINN: begin of measurement\nMESS_DATUM_ENDE: end of measurement\nLUFTTEMPERATUR: mean air temperature in \u00b0C\nNIEDERSCHLAGSHOEHE: precipitation in mm\n\nThen proceed as in Activity 2.\n\n**Task:**<br/>\nCompare the results with your own experience. Do the temperature and precipitation meet your expectations? How do they compare to the other locations, Rome and Jena? Why do you think this might be?

Alongside classical in-situ methods like weather data analysis, field surveying or sample collection, satellite-based measurements are becoming an increasingly important source of data. Their advantage is the fast and complete coverage of large areas. However, satellite data are not always easy to interpret and need substantial analysis.\n\nThe most abundant remote sensing devices are weather satellites. By employing suitable sensors, they provide information about cloud coverage, temperature distributions, wind speed and directions, water levels and snow thickness. Keeping the evolving climate change in mind, these data play an increasingly important role in disaster management during draughts and floods and for climate simulations and atmospheric gas content and vegetation monitoring. In addition, urban and landscape management benefit from satellite data.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/Landsat_timeline.jpg)\n**Figure 1:** Overview of Landsat remote sensing satellites of NASA (NASA, https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/landsatprogram).\n\n<br/>\nThe first weather satellites were launched by NASA as early as 1960. In the early 1970s, NASA started their earth observation programme using Landsat satellites (Figure 1). In Europe, France was the first, with their SPOT satellite fleet. They were followed by the remaining European countries in the 1990s after the foundation of ESA, the European Space Agency.\n\n<br/>\n**The Copernicus Programme** <br/>\nSince 1997, the USA and NASA have been developing a massive programme to explore the Earth, designated the Earth Observation System, which consists of a large number of different satellites. The European equivalent, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), has been under development since 1998. In 2012, the programme was renamed to Copernicus. Information products for six applications are being derived from the satellite data: ocean, land and atmosphere monitoring; emergency response; security and climate change. The data products are offered to the public free of charge. They are supplied via two branches: space-based remote sensing devices (satellite component) and airborne, ground and marine probing (in-situ component). The core of the satellite component is the fleet of Sentinel satellites built exclusively for the Copernicus projects. They are supplemented by other domestic and commercial partner missions. The first Sentinel satellite (Sentinel 1-A) was launched in 2014. Sentinel-2A and 3-A followed in 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/Sentinel-2_brings_land_into_focus.jpg)\n**Figure 2:** Computer model of the Sentinel-2A satellite launched on 23 June 2015 (ESA/ATG medialab, http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/07/Sentinel-2_brings_land_into_focus).\n\n<br/>\n**Electromagnetic Spectrum**<br/>\nLight is the radiation that the human eye can see and interpret. However, the full range of electromagnetic radiation (the spectrum) is much wider. The part that is invisible to us can be detected using special cameras, such as the ones that are part of astronomical telescopes and satellites. Figure 3 provides a good overview on the different kinds of radiation.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/EM_Spectrum_Properties_reflected.png)\n**Figure 3:** The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. The visible light is only a very small part inside the full range\n(Inductiveload, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EM_Spectrum_Properties_reflected.svg, \u201cEM Spectrum\nProperties reflected\u201c, cropped by Markus Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\n**Multispectral Imaging**<br/>\nOne of the core purposes of earth observation and remote sensing is taking and analysing pictures.\nSimilar to modern astronomy, taking images with different spectral filters is very diagnostic when\nidentifying and analysing terrestrial surface features. For this kind of data acquisition, the cameras rely on the sunlight that illuminates the Earth\u2019s surface. Hence, they receive the portion of the sunlight that is reflected by the various surface features. Compared to the incident sunlight, the reflected light is modified by brightness and spectral composition.\n\n**Table 1: Spectral bands of the MSI camera of the Sentinel-2A satellite (Sentinel Online, https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/msi-instrument)**\n\nBand | Central wavelength (\u00b5m) | Bandwidth (\u00b5m) | Spatial resolution (m) \n--- | --- | --- \n1 | 0.443 | 0.020 | 60\n2 | 0.490 | 0.065 | 10\n3 | 0.560 | 0.035 | 10\n4 | 0.665 | 0.030 | 10\n5 | 0.705 | 0.015 | 20 \n6 | 0.740 | 0.015 | 20 \n7 | 0.783 | 0.020 | 20\n8 | 0.842 | 0.115 | 10\n8a | 0.865 | 0.020 | 20\n9 | 0.945 | 0.020 | 60\n10 | 1.380 | 0.030 | 60 \n11 | 1.610 | 0.090| 20\n12 | 2.190 | 0.180| 20\n\nThe spectral bands of the multi-spectral instrument (MSI) camera of the Sentinel-2A satellite is given as an example in Table 1. For example, band 2 covers a wavelength range of 0.490 to 0.065  \u00b5m. The smallest feature that can be seen in this band would be 10 m across. These bands cannot be chosen arbitrarily because of the wavelength-dependent transparency of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere (grey area in Figure 4). They are referred to as \u2018spectral windows\u2019. The main reason for the wavelength ranges, where the atmosphere blocks external radiation, is water vapour. Therefore, observations with cameras have to be designed such that only wave bands where the radiation is transmitted well enough to receive a good signal are used. Thus, these ranges are the ones the optical filters of the cameras are designed for.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/Landsat.v.Sentinel-2.png)\n**Figure 4:** Graphical representation of the spectral bands of MSI/Sentinel-2A compared to the cameras of the Landsat 7 and 8 satellites. The axes depict the wavelength in nanometres (1 nm = 10-3 \u00b5m = 10-9 m) and the terrestrial atmospheric transmission (grey) in percent (NASA, https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/sentinel-2a-launches-our-compliments-our-complements/).\n\n<br/>\nA proper choice of optical filters not only permits differentiation between water and landscape but also allows the state of vegetation or surface conditions to be deciphered. For instance, Figure 5 indicates a noticeable difference between the reflective spectra of fresh (green curve) and dry (brown curve) grass. The main reason for this is the absorption power of chlorophyll. In particular, the transition between the red (band 4) and the infrared ranges (bands 7 to 9) sees a sudden jump in the spectrum of fresh, green grass, while the spectrum of dry grass remains rather constant. By subtracting the signals of the bands, one can distinguish between the two states.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/Sentinel2_Spectrum.png)\n**Figure 5:** Reflective spectra of fresh (green curve) and dry (brown curve) grass in a wavelength range covered by the MSI/Sentinel-2 bands (yellow curves labelled at the top of the graph). There is a strong jump in the green grass spectrum between bands 4 and 7 (USGS Spectral Viewer, NASA, http://landsat.usgs.gov/tools_viewer.php).\n\n<br/>\nSatellite images contain pixel values that represent the brightness or intensity of the light reflected by the surface and detected in an optical band. They are usually displayed in greyscale. Combining these images following the rules of the additive mixture of colour stimuli enables the construction of colour images. When selecting the images of the spectral bands representing the colours red, green and blue, the resulting RGB image shows the colours in a realistic way (Figure 6, left).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/6.png)\n**Figure 6:** Images obtained with MSI/Sentinel-2A. Left: Realistic RGB coloured image of the city of Milan; right: false colour visualisation of the area around the river Po, Italy. The colour red represents the near infrared band which is sensitive to green vegetation (Copernicus data 2015/ESA, https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/c-missions/copernicus-sentinel-2).\n\n<br/>\n**Spectral Index**<br/>\nBy merging data from different optical bands, a lot can be learnt about vegetation or construction areas in a qualitative way (Figure 6, right). If quantitative information is required, however, a more detailed analysis is needed. An established tool for this is the spectral index. This is a number that is calculated from data obtained at different wavelengths and allows a comparison of the relative brightness of different wavelengths of light that is reflected by the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\n<br/>\n*Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI)*<br/>\nAn important spectral index used to identify healthy vegetation is the Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI). It is calculated from the measured intensities obtained in the red (R) and near infrared (NIR) spectral regimes. As mentioned, the transition between these bands helps distinguished between green vegetation and other features (Figure 5). It is calculated as follows:\n\nNDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R)\n\nWith:\nR:\tIntensity/brightness of reflected light in the red filter (ca. 0.6\u20130.7 \u00b5m)\nNIR:\tIntensity/brightness of reflected light in the near infrared filter (ca. 0.8\u20130.9 \u00b5m)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/globalndvi_tmo_200711_lrg.jpg)\n**Figure 7:** NDVI world map based on November 2007 data of the \u2018Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\u2019 of the NASA Terra satellite (NASA, http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=8622).\n\n<br/>\nNDVI is measured using bands 4 and 8 of the Sentinel-2 MSI camera (Table 1). The difference between NIR and R is normalised by their sum, resulting in a range of values between -1 and +1. Negative values indicate water areas. A value between 0 and 0.2 represents nearly vegetation-free surfaces, while a value close to +1 indicates high coverage of green vegetation.\n\n<br/>\n*Normalised Differenced Moisture Index (NDMI)*<br/>\nAnother spectral index is the Normalised Differenced Moisture Index (NDMI) or Normalised Differenced Water Index (NDWI). It is sensitive to humid vegetation and open wetlands. It supplements the NDVI.\n\nNDMI = (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)\n\nWith:\nNIR:\tIntensity/brightness of reflected light in the near infrared filter (ca. 0.8\u20130.9 \u00b5m)\nSWIR:\tIntensity/brightness of reflected light in the shortwave infrared filter (ca. 1.5\u20131.8 \u00b5m)\n\nThe NDMI helps distinguish between dry and wet areas.\n\n<br/>\n*Modified Normalised Differenced Water Index (MNDWI)*<br/>\nThe Modified Normalised Differenced Water Index (MNDWI) is regarded as an advanced version of the NDMI. It helps identify open wetland and excludes artificial buildings, vegetation and agricultural areas.\n\nMNDWI = (G - SWIR) / (G + SWIR)\n\nWith:\nG:\tIntensity/brightness of reflected light in the green filter (ca. 0.5\u20130.6 \u00b5m)\nSWIR:\tIntensity/brightness of reflected light in the shortwave infrared filter (ca. 1.5\u20131.8 \u00b5m)\n\nOpen wetland shows higher positive values with the MNDWI than with the NDWI, while other landmarks like buildings, vegetation and crop land show negative values.\n\n<br/>\n*The LEO Works 4.0 software*<br/>\nESA has developed an educational tool for teaching and learning the basic steps of analysing satellite data. The latest version, 4.0, is being developed by Terrasigna in Romania. Since it is based on Java, it is independent of the operating system. It will be used for the present activity.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/leoworks.png)\n**Figure 8:** Launch window of LEO Works 4.0, a software for treating and analysing satellite data for educational purposes.

The exercise is interspersed with questions to evaluate the students\u2019 understanding as well as to point to the relevance of the satellite data. Some tasks involve very similar and repetitive procedures that are used to reinforce the steps used in the analysis.\n\nAnalysis of satellite imagery data using LEO Works 4.0\nThis activity introduces the basic tasks for processing and analysing remote sensing satellite data. \n\nThe installed version already contains some example datasets that can be used for the purpose of the exercise.

A bad contrast will lead to pale colours. For a realistic impression, the three bands representing blue, green, and red have to be selected.\n\n**Action: Find the corresponding bands in Table 2. If you need help assigning colours to wavelengths, research the missing information on the internet.**\n\nSelect View\\New RGB View. A new window appears (Figure 14). Choose the matching bands for red, green, blue and click on OK. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig13.png)\n**Figure 14:** Window for selecting the bands to be used for constructing an RGB image.\n\n<br/>\nA new colour image appears. If necessary, you can adjust the colours with Interactive Stretching.\n\n**Actions: Inspect the result and try to identify landscape elements (buildings, water, soil, vegetation).**\n\n**Find the airport.**\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig14.png)\n**Figure 15:** Three-colour image (RGB) created from satellite data of Venice.\n\n<br/>\n*Creating a false colour image*<br/>\nYou have just produced an RGB image that corresponds to the natural impression of colours how humans see it. It consists of the colours red, green, and blue. Imagine other species like bees or snakes. They can see other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum like the ultraviolet (UV) or the infrared (IR). We can simulate such kind of vision skills by combining different spectral bands than red, green and blue. The resulting colours do not match the natural ones we can see with our eyes, but they can help making interesting details visible.\n\nUse the knowledge that the chlorophyll in green plants absorbs red light but reflects infrared\nradiation.\n\n**Actions: Produce a three-colour image from the near infrared (ca. 0.8 \u00b5m), red (ca. 0.65 \u00b5m), and green (ca. 0.5 \u00b5m).**\n\n**What are the corresponding bands?**\n\n**Put the infrared band in the red channel, the red band in the green channel and the green band in the blue channel of the RGB image.**\n\n**Compare this image with Figure 15. Where do you find green vegetation?** \n\n**Can you distinguish between green crops and green water (algae)?** \n\n**What does uncultivated land look like?**\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig15.png)\n**Figure 16:** False colour image produced by combining the green, red and infrared bands.\n\n<br/>\n*Analysis via NDVI*<br/>\nYou have already seen in the information section that the NDVI is a colour or spectral index\n\nNDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R)\n\nthat is particularly sensitive to green vegetation. The index provides a number that objectively\nreflects the degree of vegetation. Remember that there is a jump in the spectrum of green vegetation between the red (R) and the infrared (NIR) range (Figure 5). You will now construct a map that contains the NDVI for every image pixel. LEO Works provides a tool for this.\n\n**Action: Find the NDVI tool.** \n\nAfter activating that tool, a new window pops up (Figure 17). You select the dataset at the top. The\nnext line contains the name of the image to be constructed and how it appears in the list of data. A name is already suggested. Select the suitable bands in the following rows below.\n\n**Action: What are the bands to be selected here? The answer can be found in the section about the NDVI and Table 2.** \n\nThe formula is shown below. In the beginning, the variables show \u201cnull\u201d as long as no band is\nselected. It is automatically updated as soon as you select the band corresponding to the NIR and\nthe R bands. The NDVI map is created by clicking OK. A suitable false colour representation is chosen automatically, which helps identify green vegetation. However, the scaling of the colour table must be adjusted.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig16.png)\n**Figure 17:** Window of the NDVI computing tool.\n\n<br/>\nThe tool Color manipulation is used for this. Move the flags of maximum value to the upper end of the distribution histogram. Then move the flag of the minimum value until the first green coloured flag reaches a value of 0.2 (Figure 18). The new setting is adopted after clicking Apply.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig17.png)\n**Figure 18:** Window that allows adjusting\n\n<br/>\nThe result should look similar to Figure 19. You see large white zones with alternating yellow and\ngreen areas in between.\n\n**Action: Compare the NDVI map with the previously produced images. What can you say about the degree of vegetation in the green and yellow areas?**\n\n**Would you be able to detect a seasonal change, if the images were taken at a monthly rate?**\n\n**What would be the situation during a draught?**\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig18.png)\n**Figure 19:** Map of the NDVI in the vicinity of Venice, based on Landsat 7 satellite data.\n\n<br/>\n*Analysis via MNDWI*<br/>\nYou will now use the satellite data to identify open wetland with the MNDWI.\nMNDWI = (G - SWIR) / (G + SWIR)\n\nEspecially small ponds and narrow rivers are not easily found on naturally coloured images. The\nMNDWI can theoretically be constructed using the NDVI tool. However, the correct assignment of\nthe corresponding bands can be confusing. LEO Works provides a generic tool to does all kinds of\nmathematical operations with the spectral bands. The procedure is called Band arithmetic.\n\n**Action: Find the tool in the tool bar or in the menu and open it.**\n\nSimilar to the tool for calculating the NDVI, you first select the dataset and the name of the image to construct (Figure 20, left). Then click Edit expression \u2026 for opening a new window (Figure 20, right). This is where you enter the formula for calculating the spectral index.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig19.png)\n**Figure 20:** Window for doing mathematical operations on the spectral band images.\n\n<br/>\n**Action: Find out what bands are needed to calculate the MNDWI.**\n\nFrom the formula of this index you see that you divide the difference of the intensities of the\nreflected light measured in two spectral bands by their sum. Be careful with placing operators and\nbrackets according to the formula.\n\nAfter confirming the formula, it also appears in the first window. The procedure is executed by\nclicking OK.\n\nThe resulting image presents the values of the index in greyscale. To improve the readability of the map, you can change colours to certain values via the Color manipulation tool. A colour table is\nassigned by clicking on the symbol \u201cImport palette\u201d as shown in Figure 21.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig20.png)\n**Figure 21:** Colours can be assigned to image values to improve the readability of the map.\n\n<br/>\n**Action: Select the file gradient_red_white_blue.cpd.**<br/>\n\n**Adjust the flags such that the values are well covered and the central flag represents the value 0.**<br/>\n\n**What is the colour coding of water?**<br/>\n\n**Compare the MNDWI map with the previously produced images. Would you be able to find wetland also on the naturally coloured image?**<br/>\n\n**Can you imagine situations for which the identification of water levels can be important or even life-saving?**<br/>\n\n**What would the image look like, if the water level rises?**\n\n**If you have time, produce a map of the NDMI. Compare it with the other results.**\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/77a458b3-ecdb-4a6e-b517-8d4b906a37a8/fig21.png)\n**Figure 22:** Map of the MNDWI in the vicinity of Venice based on Landsat 7 satellite data.\n\n<br/>\n*For advanced students*<br/>\nTwo additional datasets are provided that show the same area in January and July 2002.

Ma per dimensioni, rispetto ad altri tipi di stelle, il Sole \u00e8 nella media: il raggio (massa) del pi\u00f9 piccolo tipo di stelle, chiamato \"nane brune\", pu\u00f2 partire da 0,05 raggi solari (0,01 massa solare) mentre quello del pi\u00f9 grande tipo di stelle, chiamate \"supergiganti\" o \"ipergiganti\", pu\u00f2 raggiungere i 1000 raggi solari (200 masse solari).\nIl Sole produce la sua energia dalle reazioni termonucleari che si svolgono nel suo nucleo, dove la temperatura raggiunge i 15 milioni di gradi. Questo processo, che consiste nel \"bruciare\" l'idrogeno e trasformarlo in elio, va avanti da 4,5 miliardi di anni e dovrebbe durare all'incirca per altrettanti anni.\n\nLa superficie del Sole, chiamata \"fotosfera\", \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 fredda del suo nucleo, con una temperatura di 5500 \u00b0C. In alcune zone della fotosfera, chiamate \"macchie solari\", la temperatura viene abbassata di circa 1000 \u00b0C a causa dell'azione del campo magnetico che \"fora\" la superficie in questi punti. Questo li fa sembrare pi\u00f9 scuri della zona circostante. Le macchie appaiono sempre in coppia con polarit\u00e0 magnetiche opposte. (le quattro aree di forma irregolare sull'immagine tattile). L'attivit\u00e0 del Sole pu\u00f2 essere misurata dal numero di macchie che appaiono sulla fotosfera durante un particolare anno. Questa attivit\u00e0 varia periodicamente lungo un ciclo di circa 11 anni. L'ultimo minimo si \u00e8 verificato alla fine del 2008 e il prossimo massimo \u00e8 previsto nel 2013-2014. Tuttavia, tra due cicli consecutivi, il campo magnetico si inverte; quindi un ciclo completo dura in realt\u00e0 22 anni.\n\nAltre caratteristiche notevoli del Sole sono le \"protuberanze solari\" (anelli di filo sottile sul bordo dell'immagine tattile). Sono veri e propri ponti di materia tra punti solari, modellati dal potente campo magnetico del sole. Alcuni di essi possono essere sollevati al di sopra della fotosfera di ben 350.000 km, che \u00e8 quasi la distanza tra la Terra e la Luna. Essi possono anche essere completamente disgregati da violente esplosioni prima che tutta la materia abbia il tempo di ricadere sulla superficie: in questi casi parte della materia viene inviata attraverso il sistema solare.\n\nIl Sole ha un'atmosfera, chiamata \"cromosfera\" per via del suo colore arancione scuro. Pu\u00f2 essere visto solo durante le eclissi naturali o artificiali come uno strato sottile arancione attorno alla fotosfera molto pi\u00f9 luminosa. Infine, sopra la cromosfera, si trova la \"corona\", una regione contenente gas molto rarefatto riscaldato fino a un milione di gradi da un processo che \u00e8 ancora poco conosciuto.

For instance, a kidney dish turned upside down with two pieces of egg carton glued onto it resembles a double-peaked hill.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/KidneyDish.jpg)\n**Figure 1:** Commercial kidney dish made of paper pulp.\n<br/>\n\nKidney dishes can be purchased at a low price, e.g. from local pharmacies, medical supply stores or online stores, like\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/St-John-Ambulance-Kidney-Disposable/dp/B00TGY71JE/\n\nNevertheless, it is advisable to look for a hard surface that prevents the skewers from poking into the model during the activity.\n\nIn this example, we use a double-peaked hill made of plaster.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/landscape.png)\n**Figure 2:** Landscape model made of plaster.

For each grid point, poke a hole in the lid.\n", "background": "**Remote sensing** <br/>\nThe term \u2018remote sensing\u2019 indicates a measurement technique that probes and analyses the Earth from outer space. Besides classical in-situ methods like weather data analysis, field surveying or sample collection, satellite-based measurements are becoming an increasingly important source of data. Their advantage is the fast and complete coverage of large areas. However, satellite data are not always easy to interpret and need substantial analysis. In addition, they still need to be combined with direct measurements to correct for calibration artefacts.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Landsat_timeline.jpg)\n**Figure 3:** Overview of NASA Landsat remote sensing satellites (Credit: U.S. Geological Survey \nDepartment of the Interior/USGS).\n\n<br/>\nThe most abundant remote sensing devices are weather satellites. By employing suitable sensors, they provide information about cloud coverage, temperature distributions, wind speed and directions, water levels and snow thickness. Keeping the evolving climate change in mind, these data play an increasingly important role in disaster management during draughts and floods and for climate simulations, atmospheric gas content and vegetation monitoring. In addition, urban and landscape management benefit from satellite data.\n\nThe first weather satellites were launched by NASA as early as 1960. In the early 1970s, NASA started their earth observation programme using Landsat satellites (Figure 1). In Europe, France was the first, with their SPOT satellite fleet. This was followed by the remaining European countries in the 1990s after the foundation of ESA, the European Space Agency.\n\n<br/>\n**The Copernicus Programme**<br/>\nSince 1997, the USA and NASA have been developing a massive programme to explore the Earth, designated the Earth Observation System, which consists of a large number of different satellites. The European equivalent, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), has been under development since 1998. In 2012, the programme was renamed to Copernicus. Information products for six applications are being derived from the satellite data: ocean, land and atmosphere monitoring; emergency response; security and climate change. The data products are offered to the public free of charge. They are supplied via two branches: space-based remote sensing devices (satellite component) and airborne, ground and marine probing (in-situ component). The core of the satellite component is the fleet of Sentinel satellites built exclusively for the Copernicus projects. They are supplemented by other domestic and commercial partner missions. The first Sentinel satellite (Sentinel 1-A) was launched in 2014. Sentinel-2A and 3-A followed in 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Sentinel-1.jpg) \n**Figure 4:** Computer model of the Sentinel-1A satellite launched on 3 April 2014 (Credit: ESA/ATG medialab).\n\n<br/>\n**Radar altimetry**<br/>\nRadar altimetry is a procedure used to identify differences in altitude on different terrains. Radar (radio detection and ranging) is a standardised method for measuring the height of the Earth\u2019s surface. Satellites emit very short radio pulses (a few picoseconds, 1 ps = 10-12 s) with frequencies of several gigahertz which are reflected by the Earth and received in return. The duration of the signal turnaround (ranging) is a measure of the distance between the surface and the satellite. The signal itself also contains information about the composition of the ground that reflect the signals in different ways depending on the conditions.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/methode_en.jpg)\n**Figure 5:** Illustration of the procedure of radar altimetry (Credit: CNES/D. Ducros, http://www.altimetry.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/methode_en.jpg).\n\n<br/>\nSatellites that apply this kind of measuring technique include Envisat, Jason-1, CryoSat and Sentinel-3A. In contrast to satellites that acquire images at visual wavelengths, radar satellites are largely independent of weather conditions and daylight. Radio waves transmit through clouds and so can probe the Earth\u2019s surface even through thick cloud coverage. Since their wavelength is considerably higher than that of the visual range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the spatial resolution is worse. This disadvantage, however, can be overcome by special measuring and data analysis techniques. In addition, with advances in technology, each new generation of instruments has greater sensitivity and accuracy than the previous generation.\n\nAn important application of radar today is determining the varying thickness of ice on sea and land. This information provides clues about the worsening climate change and the amount of water originating from thawing ice. A satellite launched for exactly this purpose is the European CryoSat-2. The data obtained from radar altimetry using this satellite are used to produce topographical maps that provide altitude information.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/sea_ice_thickness_976_v5.jpg)\n**Figure 6:** A colour-coded altitude map of the Arctic ice cover based on measurements of the CryoSat-2 satellite (Credit: BBC News, 21 June 2011; CPOM/UCL/ESA).\n\n<br/>\n**Colour-coded altitude map**<br/>\nConventional maps are typically two-dimensional bird\u2019s eye views that provide constellations of landmarks and objects like roads, cities and borders. A simple method to indicate altitudes on maps is colour coding (Figure 6). This is done by assigning colours to selected altitude ranges. This provides an overview of altitude distributions with the same spatial resolution as the measuring grid. An example how to produce such a map is given further below.\n\n<br/>\n**Contour lines**<br/>\nParticularly in topographical maps, altitudes are represented by contour lines that indicate zones of equal altitudes. An example is given in Figure 7, which provides both altitudes above and depths below sea level.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Mackinac_Island_topographic_map-en.png)\n**Figure 7:** Example of a topographical map with contour lines (Credit: Eric Gaba (Sting - fr:Sting), https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mackinac_Island_topographic_map-en.svg, \u2018Mackinac Island topographic map-en\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nOne can imagine contour lines as intersections of horizontal cuts through the landscape at equidis-tant altitude steps.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Fig 8.png)\n**Figure 8:** Illustration of the generation of contour lines indicating altitude. Contour lines can be regarded as the intersec-tions of horizontal cuts through the landscape at equidistant altitude steps (Credit: Bavarian Surveying Administration).\n\n<br/>\nThe geometry of the contour lines allows one to derive the characteristics of the landscape from them. The closer the lines are aligned to each other, the steeper is the slope. Closed lines indicate a summit or a trough.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/peak.png)\n**Figure 9:** Closed lines with increasing altitude from the outside in indicate a summit (Credit: Bavarian Surveying Admini-stration).\n\n<br/>\n**Constructing altitude maps**\nAltitude or topographic maps provide information on the geometry of landscapes in all three dimensions, provided the underlying grid of altitude measurements is sufficiently dense. In the example to be used in this section, we assume an area that was probed with an equidistant 4 \u00d7 4 grid. The results are given in Table 1. The numbers are without units because they are irrelevant for this example. In reality, they can be given in metres, kilometres or the signal travel time.\n\n**Table 1: Grid of simulated altitude measurements. The numbers represent altitudes in arbitrary units.** <br/>\n\n | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 \n--- | --- | --- | --- \nRow 1 | 1 | 4 | 7 | 10 \nRow 2 | 2 | 5 | 8 | 11 \nRow 3 | 2 | 7 | 12 | 17 \nRow 4 | 3 | 6 | 12 | 24\n\n\nThe simplest way of producing a map from this is to construct a colour-coded altitude map as shown in Figure 10. The choice of colours can support data interpretation. In this example, a colour map from dark blue via green, yellow and orange up to red is chosen. This corresponds to the colours of a rainbow or the visual light spectrum.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/10.png)\n**Figure 10:** Colour-coded altitude map based on the simulated altitude measurements. The distribution of colours corre-sponds to the coordinate grid of the measurement. The colours depict the intervals 0\u20133, 4\u20137, 8\u201311, 12\u201315, etc.\n\n<br/>\nA computer-generated profile of the measurements is shown in Figure 11. It can be reproduced using MS Excel 2010 with the data plotted as a surface chart. As expected, small numbers indicate low altitudes and large numbers correspond to high altitudes. Altitude ranges are also colour coded. The intersections between colours can be interpreted as altitude contour lines. The next paragraphs demonstrate how contour maps can be constructed manually.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_Example.png)\n**Figure 11:** Profile of the simulated measurements. The altitude ranges are indicated as coloured zones. The intersections indicate contour lines.\n\n<br/>\nThe individual steps are given in Figure 12. Sketch a represents the regular 4 \u00d7 4 measurement grid. The distances between the vertices define the scale of the map. The data obtained at those grid points are added in sketch b to help find the interpolated values in the next step. They should not be added to the real map.\n\nA set of equidistant altitudes should be chosen for interpolation. In this example, we select 6, 9, 12, and 15. The corresponding values are found by linear interpolation \u2013 both horizontally and vertically. For instance, 6 must lie between 5 and 7. The proper positions are found by applying a linear equation between two neighbouring data points.\n\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/contourLineConstruction.jpg)\n**Figure 12:** Construction of an altitude contour map. a) Regular 4 \u00d7 4 measurement grid; b) assignment of numbers to the 16 data points; c) horizontally and vertically interpolated data points for a given altitude; d) smooth connection of inter-polated altitudes; e) interpolated contour lines of additional altitudes; f) resulting altitude contour map.\n\n<br/>\nImagine the distribution of altitude measurements shown in Figure 11 from a side perspective. Two neighbouring data points define a line (Figure 13). Interpolating between individual values can then be done by applying linear equations. The measured values are assumed to be h_1 at position s_1 and h_2 at s_2. The slope of the connecting line is calculated as follows.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 1.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/interpolate.png)\n**Figure 13:** Visualisation of the linear interpolation between two data points.\n\n<br/>\nPosition s of interpolated value h must lie between s_1 and s_2, which we assume to be separated by \u2206s=10 units. This position can be determined by using the previous equation and deriving\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 2.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 3.png)\n\nIn line with the example given in Figure 13, known variables have the following values:\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 4.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 5.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 6.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 7.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 8.png)\n\n<br/>\nWe want to construct the interpolated contour line for value 6. This means\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 9.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Equation 10.png)\n\nThe interpolated data point that belongs to the contour line of value 6 can be found at a distance of 6 units from grid point s_1. This must be repeated for all neighbouring pairs of values. The result is given in Figure 12c. The resulting points are connected with a smooth line, which leads to sketch d. Applying this procedure to all contour line values results in sketch e. The proper altitude contour map is given in sketch f.\n\nIn general, interpolating is not allowed between diagonally neighbouring grid points, because the interpolated lines usually do not lie within the plane of the square that is formed by four neighbouring grid points (Figure 14).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/doNotInterpolate.png)\n**Figure 14:** Diagonal lines of a measuring grid that consists of square cells (grey) are generally not in the plane of the square.

This helps distribute the work (measuring, documenting the data, plotting, etc.).\n\nRemember that the second activity (contour map) is particularly time consuming. So, select in advance map-making exercises that fit your time frame.\n\n**Important!** The worksheets have to be adjusted to fit the landscape model and the measuring grid envisaged for this activity.\n\nEach group will receive one box with the hidden landscape model inside.

For every 3 seconds, the distance would be 1 km.\n\nQ: Why does this technique work?<br/>\nA: The speed of sound is considerably lower than the speed of light. Thus, time required for sound to travel is a measure of distance.\n\nQ: Can you also define distances based on the speed of light? What are the units of distance be-tween stars?<br/>\nA: A lightyear is the distance light propagates within a year. So, if one can measure how long light takes to travel from a source to a receiver, one can infer the distance.\n\nQ: The problem is that clouds can block light. Are there other kinds of light/electromagnetic waves that could be used instead? If they need assistance, mention systems that measure the distances between ships and boats or to airplanes.<br/>\nA: Radar\n\nQ: How do radar stations work?<br/>\nA: Signals are emitted, reflected off the target and received again. The signal travel time is used to calculate the distance.\n\nQ: Can you imagine a technology that permits the measurement of the height of the Earth\u2019s surface at various points?<br/>\nA: Radar technology combined with low-orbiting satellites should be able to do this.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 1: PAINTING BY NUMBERS -CONSTRUCTING A COLOUR-CODED ALTITUDE MAP (Mandatory)**\nThe students are provided a box containing a landscape model that they cannot see. In addition, they have a skewer, a length measuring device and the worksheet to note down the measurements.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Activity1.png)\n**Figure 15:** Schematic view of a landscape model inside a box with a measuring grid on top (Credit: O. Fischer, HdA).\n\n<br/>\nThe students use the skewer as a measuring rod. They insert it in each hole or through each grid position and slide it down gently until it hits solid material (Figure 15). If the surface of the model is deformable, tell the students not to use too much force. It is important that the skewer remains perpendicular to the plane of the lid at all times. Then, they measure the length of the protruding end of the skewer and note down the value in the table cell that represents that position on the box. A precision of 5 mm should be sufficient.\n\nAfter covering all grid points, they will have filled the table completely. Table 2 shows the result for the current example.\n\nLet the students analyse the result: \n- What are the minimum and maximum values?\n- Where is the peak?\n\n**Table 2: Table of altitude measurements used in this example.** <br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Table 2.png)\n\nAsk the students if they can easily recognise the topography of the probed item. They will probably deny this. It would be quite difficult to imagine.\n\nShow them the example of the colour-coded ice surface map in Figure 6 or any other topographical map, e.g. in an atlas. Ask the students if they can identify different altitudes. They will probably realise that colour coding is a viable approach to visualise the measurement.\n\nDiscuss with the whole group the number of reasonable steps for the colour coding of their own map. Usually, a colour table starting from violet for low numbers through different shades of blue, green, yellow, orange and red is suitable for assigning colours to number intervals.\n\nLet the students now construct a colour-coded altitude map. They can directly colour the table that has the measurements they obtained.\n\nIn the example used as template for this activity, the resulting 12 \u00d7 9 table contains numbers at 0.5 cm resolution, and this accuracy should be sufficient. Table 2 represents the results of the measurements obtained with the landscape model used in this example. The outcome naturally depends on the model prepared for this activity.\n\nConverting this table into a colour-coded altitude map results in Figure 16.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/colourCodedMapExample.png)\n**Figure 16:** Colour-coded altitude map derived from the measurements documented in Table 2.\n\n<br/>\nAfter finalising the map, discuss with the students the probable shape of the models they probed. Let them open the box to compare the hidden structure with their expectations. Did they guess what the prominent features of the model were from the map?\n\nIn this example (Figure 16), the two peaks of different heights and the ridge between them are clearly visible.\n\n\n###**ACTIVITY 2: CONSTRUCTING A CONTOUR LINE MAP (for advanced students only, can be skipped to save time)**\n\nThis activity takes quite a long time. If the teacher decides to go through with it, he/she should start with one or a few contour levels to demonstrate the concept. The rest can be left for homework, if required.\n\nTell the students that they will now learn a different way of constructing maps.\n\nQ: Is the resolution of the map constructed during activity 1 adequate to identify small-scale changes in the height of the landscape model? <br/>\nA: No, it is not.\n\nQ: Could there be a way to infer the changes in altitude between the positions of the measuring grid? Remind them that no measurement is ideal. There are no infinitely resolved measuring grids. So, how do cartographers produce maps from such information?<br/>\nA: Within certain assumptions, the altitudes between the grid positions can be derived, e.g. with suitable calculations.\n\nQ: Show them a topographical map with contour lines, e.g. Figure 7. What do the contour lines rep-resent?<br/>\nA: They are lines of equal height.\n\nQ: How is a mountain peak represented by contour lines?<br/>\nA: Peaks are identified by a series of nested closed lines.\n\nQ: How is it possible to identify such lines of equal height? Has every point on such a line been measured? Remind them of the interpolation they have studied before.<br/>\nA: Most of the data points must have been inferred from isolated, discrete measurements.\n\nThe map will be constructed according to the instructions in the background information, which the students will also receive with the worksheet.\n\nHand out the rulers, calculators and graph paper for plotting. \n\nLet the students transfer the measuring grid onto the graph paper as shown in sketch a of Figure 12.\n\nImportant: Remind them that each grid point corresponds to a cell in the table of measured values. Therefore, there should be as many intersections as there are cells in the corresponding table.\n\nLet them decide on the number and values of the interpolated contour lines. Perhaps, they will choose the same sample as the one used in activity 1. Let them begin with the largest numbers so that they cover the peaks of the landscape model.\n\nWith the equations mentioned in the background information, the students calculate the positions of the interpolated values and add them to their plot. Remind them not to interpolate diagonally. For each value, they should connect the points smoothly.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/contourMapExample.jpg)\n**Figure 17:** Contour map of altitudes increasing in steps of one constructed form the values in Table 2.\n\n<br/>\nFor the example used here, the final result is given in Figure 17.\n\nQ: Compare this (part of the) map with the result from activity 1. What are the similarities and differences?<br/>\nA: The features should be visible more easily. The contour map appears to have a better resolution than the colour-coded map.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 3: CONSTRUCT A 3D SURFACE MAP WITH MICROSOFT EXCEL**\n\nProvide the working groups with PCs equipped with MS Excel. This activity only works with software version 2010 or later. Only they can produce surface plots. If the teacher chooses to use different spreadsheet software, it is important that it also can produce surface maps.\n\nQ: What other tools can you imagine could produce such maps? What do you think professional cartographers use? <br/>\nA: Computers, of course.\n\nTell them that with this activity, they will actually do what cartographers do.\n\nLet the students transfer the table of measured values into a table in Excel (Figure 18).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_TableExample.png)\n**Figure 18:** Excel table of measured values.\n\n<br/>\nThe students will work on their own, equipped only with the instructions provided in the worksheet. In order to plot the table as a surface plot, the students highlight the entire table including row and column labels with the mouse and then select *Insert*\\*Other charts*\\*Surface *(first icon).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_InsertMap.png)\n**Figure 19:** The surface plot can be produced via *Insert*\\*Other Charts*. \n\n<br/>\nA new window appears, containing a surface plot of the altitude measurements. This is already a good representation of the hidden landscape model. However, the scaling and the colour coding are initially arbitrary and need to be adjusted.\n\nTo modify the scaling, first click on the graph window to activate it. Then click on the tick values next to the vertical axis. A grey frame will appear. Then double-click, and a new window pops up (Figure 20). Change the options of \u2018Minimum\u2019, \u2018Maximum\u2019 and \u2018Major unit\u2019 from \u2018Auto\u2019 to \u2018Fixed\u2019. Then enter the minimum and maximum integer values from the measurement. In this example, these are 5 and 15. \u2018Major unit\u2019 indicates the step size for the scaling and the subsequent colour coding, which is 1 in this example.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_AdjustScale.png)\n**Figure 20:** Axis options window of MS Excel.\n\n<br/>\nTo change the colour coding, click on the legend. Again, a grey frame appears. Then select the colour to be changed by clicking with the left mouse button. Then right-click and a small pop-up window appears that permits colour changes (Figure 21). Select the one that indicates \u2018Shape fill\u2019, i.e. the bucket. From the panel, any colour can be chosen. Do this for all entries of the legend.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_AdjustColour.png)\n**Figure 21:** The colour coding can be adjusted via the legend.\n\n<br/>\nNote that the order of the rows initially displayed in the plot is from bottom to top, which differs from the input table. The order can be changed by double-clicking on the row axis and selecting Series in reverse order in the new window (Figure 22).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_AdjustOrder.png)\n**Figure 22:** Dialogue window of MS Excel to change the settings of an axis. The axis representing the rows of the input table should be reversed.\n\n<br/>\nAdjusting the viewing angles on the plot can be achieved by right-clicking on the plot and selecting 3-D Rotation. The new window enables modification of the three angles of orientation (Figure 23).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_AdjustAngle.png)\n**Figure 23:** Options for rotating the surface map along three angles in space.\n\n<br/>\nThe students will produce two versions that show the data from different viewing angles. One should be right from the top and one should be from an angle that well represents the landscape model (Figure 24).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a17ab86f-a2d4-4c42-b554-4452e4e85eab/Excel_Model.png)\n**Figure 24:** Surface plots of the altitude measurements used in the example.\n\n<br/>\nCompare the results with the ones from the other activities.\n\nLet the students discuss the different techniques used to construct a map. How well is the real structure represented? Was the spatial sampling of the measurement sufficient?\n\n###**CONCLUSION**\n\nDiscuss the advantages and applications of satellite radar altimetry.\n\nQ: Map services like Google Earth have altitude information stored for each map position. How was that obtained? <br/>\nA: Via satellites\n\nQ: Why have satellites been used for this? What is their advantage over on-ground measurements?<br/>\nA: Satellite measurements are faster, more consistent and have wider and denser coverage.\n\nQ: Can you imagine particular applications of radar altitude measurements taken from space?<br/>\nA: Possible answers are\n- ice shield monitoring\n- flood or disaster management\n- plate tectonics and mountain range monitoring\n- monitoring water level rise and climate change", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "This activity is part of a larger educational package, the \u2018Our Fragile Planet: The Climate Box\u2019 toolkit, and is linked to the activity \u2018The Big Meltdown\u2019.", "conclusion": "This lesson contains three activities that teach different ways of visualising data from altitude measurements. A landscape model hidden inside a box is probed with a rod to obtain the altitude distribution on a regular grid. This simulates the method of radar altimetry used by satellites with low Earth orbits. These data are translated into three different maps (colour coding, contour map and computer-generated surface map) requiring varying levels of effort for construction. From this, students learn how to interpret such maps. When discussing the applications, they understand that radar altimetry is a powerful tool that helps in many different sectors like monitoring of climate change indicators and disaster management.\n", "alert_message": "", "short_desc_material": "There are 2 attachments: Worksheet editable and Worksheet PDF.

For this, one needs known reference points from which one\u2019s own position can be derived. Satellite navigation provides moving references, i.e. satellites. The most prominent satellite navigation system is the Global Positioning System (GPS) (see corresponding section below). While few know how it actually works, most people know that is used in car navigation and in modern smartphones.\n\nTo derive one\u2019s own location on Earth, the basic step is determining the distance to the satellites. From this, the desired location can be calculated. This technique is called trilateration. To measure the distance to those satellites, the constant speed of light is used. If one knows the duration a signal takes to travel from the source to the receiver, the known velocity directly yields the distance.\n\nAn analogue to this technique is estimating the distance to a thunderstorm by noting the time between a flash of lightning and the sound of thunder. Since lightning arrives almost instantly, the travel time of the following thunder can be converted into distance. The conversion is done by using the sound speed. Under normal circumstances, the sound of thunder travels 1 km in approximately 3 seconds (v = 343.2 m/s). If several observers calculate the interval between lightning and thunder from different positions, the location of the thunderstorm can be determined.\n\nThe challenge with satellite navigation is to exactly measure the signal travel time. Each transmitted signal contains a code that provides information about the corresponding satellite, its position and the time of transmission. Each satellite is equipped with an extremely exact and synchronised atomic clock. On receiving the signal, the clock inside the GPS receiver helps calculate the time the signal needed to travel.\n\nImagine a satellite sends a signal. After a given duration, the signal will have covered the same distance in all directions. Hence, it is transmitted on the surface of a sphere.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/GPS_Scheme_01.jpg)\n**Figure 1:** Configuration of two satellites. Position A on Earth receives the signals after 4 and 5 seconds, respectively. The two signals intersect at points A and B. Since only A is on Earth, B can be discarded (own work).\n\n<br/>\nFor the rest of this activity, the three-dimensional configuration of Earth and the satellites will be represented by simplified two-dimensional illustrations. The surface of the satellite signal wave front will be depicted by circles instead of spheres. Consequently, the intersections of two satellite signals are points instead of lines or arcs. This is done to improve the visibility of the illustrations.\n\nThe principle of positioning is shown in Figure 1. At an unknown position on Earth, the signals of the two satellites arrive at 4 and 5 seconds, respectively. Therefore, the location must be at one of the two intersections. Since only A is on Earth, position B can be discarded. However, this only works well, if the signal travel time is measured very accurately. Unfortunately, the clocks of the GPS receivers are usually quite inaccurate. If, for example, the receiving clock is 0.5 s fast, the measured intersection is A\u2019 instead of A in Figure 2. The positioning is equally inaccurate. Therefore, at this step, the term pseudorange is introduced, which is the assumed distance to one of the satellites derived from the face values of time measurement.\n\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/GPS_Scheme_02.jpg)\n**Figure 2:** The same configuration as in Figure 1, but this time with a receiving clock running 0.5 s fast. Therefore, the signal transmission times are measured to be 0.5 s longer. This results in an intersection at A' instead of A (own work).\n\n<br/>\nThis error can be reduced by adding another satellite (Figure 3). Again, the signal travel time is erroneously measured as 0.5 s later. This configuration is different from the previous situation with two satellites as it produces three intersections. It now becomes obvious that the measurement is inaccurate, and the true position must be surrounded by the apparent ones.\n\nThe GPS receiver notices the incompatible pseudoranges. It initiates an algorithm that changes the time of the receiver clock until a common intersection is found, or the difference between the pseudoranges is minimised. The GPS receiver clock can be corrected accordingly, and that speeds up the following positioning attempts. Each additional satellite improves the precision.\n\nAs mentioned before, this illustration uses a 2-D configuration. In reality, at least four satellites are needed to locate a position on Earth with acceptable accuracy.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/GPS_Scheme_03.jpg)\n**Figure 3:** A third satellite is added, whose signal travel time is again measured wrongly. This leads to three intersections A' surrounding the true position A (own work).\n\n<br/> \n**Modern applications of satellite navigation**<br/>\nInitially, satellite navigation was developed for military purposes. Today, it is crucial for many modern commercial businesses and transport services. Often, we do not even notice that satellite positioning is involved. Different navigational techniques that were introduced for a large variety of transport vessels have now been replaced by satellite navigation (cars, trucks, ships, airplanes). They play a role in services as simple as package tracking and as complex as helping businesses distribute their goods. Satellite navigation can also help save lives; for example, an autonomous emergency system can automatically transmit the location of a car that has been involved in an accident.\n\n<br/>\n**GPS and Galileo**<br/>\nGlobal systems of satellites used for positioning and navigation are called global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The most renowned GNSS is the GPS (Global Positioning System), or officially Navstar GPS. It was developed by the US military in the 1970s. Currently, it consists of 32 satellites, of which at least 24 are always operational. They are orbiting Earth at an altitude of 20200 km and on 6 trajectories inclined with respect to each other.\n\nAlthough it was originally designed for military purposes, its full capabilities have been available for general and civil use since 2000. Nevertheless, the USA holds the right to artificially reduce the accuracy of the GPS for tactical reasons at any time. Since many civilian applications rely on fully working services of the GPS, they are potentially in constant danger to fail.\n\nThis is one reason, and not necessarily the least, why the European Union (EU) decided to develop their own GNSS called Galileo, to be controlled by civilian authorities. However, it is also intended to serve tactical, security and defence purposes. Galileo will be compatible with other GNSS like the US-based GPS, the Russian GLONASS as well as the Chinese Beidou.\n\nAt the same time, the USA is currently working on a third generation of the GPS. The new satellites will be equipped with an additional signal band that makes them compatible with the Galileo system. Moreover, they will lack the option to intentionally reduce the accuracy of the positioning.\n\nIn 2017, the fleet of 30 Galileo satellites, of which 6 are spares, is still incomplete. They will be in three orbits inclined with respect to one another and at an altitude of 23222 km. First services were initiated in 2016. Full operations are expected to start in 2020.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/30-satellite_Galileo_constellation.jpg)\n**Figure 4:** Illustration of the satellite orbits of the Galileo GNSS (Credit: ESA/P. Carril).\n\n<br/>\nThe accuracy of Galileo is expected to be of the order of 4 m without any additional corrections. This is about 3 times better than what the GPS can achieve. Galileo can reach higher accuracies and precisions by including terrestrial reference stations (differential GPS). In this way, Galileo will be accurate enough for applications in aerial, marine and land navigation. In common car navigation devices, it will be possible to determine the driving lane.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/Galileo_FOC.jpg)\n**Figure 5:** Computer image of a Galileo satellite (Credit: ESA/P. Carril).\n\n**Signal speed** <br/>\nRadio signals are electromagnetic waves that travel at the speed of light. In vacuum conditions, its value is 299792458 m/s, according to the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures).\n\n<br/>\n**Graphical approximation of centre of mass** <br/>\nAt the end of this activity, the students have to determine their location inside an area of intersection constructed by arcs drawn with compasses. A real GPS receiver runs an interpolation algorithm to determine the location and the clock correction. The students will use a simpler approach that approximates the correct result.\n\nGiven is an irregularly shaped area confined by four lines (Figure 6). The first step is to determine the bisectors of each of the four lines. In the second step, the opposing bisectors are connected with lines. This results in two crossing lines whose intersection is an approximation of the centre of mass.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/Interpolation.jpg)\n**Figure 6:** Illustration of how to approximate the centre of mass of an irregular tetragon. The shape is confined by four lines (left). After finding the bisectors of each line, the opposing bisectors are connected with a line (right). The intersection is an approximation of the centre of mass (own work).\n\n<br/>\n**Average**<br/>\nAn average value is defined as a number that is the minimum of the sum of differences between the average and the individual values. In statistics, it is used to calculate a representative number when many values that scatter around the true value.\n\nIf t stands for a given value of a time measurement, we can indicate a series of measurements by adding an index, like e.g. t1, t2, t3, \u2026 which corresponds to the first, second and third value, respectively. In order to calculate the average of a series of measurements, one has to calculate the sum of the individual values and divide it by the number of measurements. For three temperature measurements, the average would be calculated as follows:\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/Equation 1.png)\n\nOr in general:\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/Equation 2.png)\n\nt \u0305 is the symbol for the average of times measured, and n is a natural number that corresponds to the number of measurements.\n\n<br/>\n**Glossary**<br/>\n*Trilateration*<br/>\nNavigational technique to determine a position by measuring the distances to at least three reference points.\n\n*Pseudorange*<br/>\nThe calculated distance to the reference points used in trilateration without applying the necessary corrections.

Ask them where they use GPS. Almost every modern mobile phone has a GPS receiver.\n\nTell them about the different GNSSs. At the end, let them summarise the content.\n\nAsk the students if they can explain how measuring the time of a signal transmitted by the satellites provides the distance to it? Help them by bringing up the analogue with the thunderstorm. There is typically at least one student that knows about it. See the introduction for details.\n\nAsk them how counting too fast/slow changes the result.\n\nTell them that with the satellites, they will have to measure the travel time of radio signals, a special kind of light, instead of the sound of the thunder. Ask them if they had an idea of how one could determine the signal travel time of a given satellite. The answer contains clocks to measure time.\n\n**Optional:**<br/>\nAfter having established that those signals are transmitted by satellites, you may want to show them where and how many satellites there are. This can be done via free apps for smartphones like e.g. GPS Essentials. However, receiving GPS signals within buildings may not be easy.\n\nAndroid:<br/>\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mictale.gpsessentials\n\nApple iPhone:<br/>\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/de/app/ultimate-gps/id403066634?mt=8\n\n###**ACTIVITY 1 (OPTIONAL): IDENTIFYING EUROPEAN COUNTRIES**\nMaterials:\n- Worksheet 1\n- Pencil\n\nDuring the actual exercise, where the students locate their simulated position, they have to use a map of Europe.

If available and necessary, hand out atlases.\n \nAs an additional optional exercise, let the students name the capitals of those countries.\n\nIn a culturally diverse classroom, the students may want to talk about the countries where they or their ancestors come from.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/GPS_Sheet.png)\n**Figure 7:** Topographical map of Europe displayed in Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection.

On your return, you were dropped off somewhere in Europe. You have no idea where you are, but luckily you have your GPS receiver with you that should guide you to a place from where you can receive help or return home.<br/>But \u2026 oh no \u2026 the receiver is broken. Instead of showing your location on Earth, it only displays the signal travel time of four receiving satellite signals. You will have to do it all by yourself.<br/>Since the clock in the receiver is not perfect, the time on the display can be off from the true value. But you can deal with that later. With the map you find in your pocket and the working calculator function of the GPS receiver, you should be able to get along.*\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/fig 8.png)\n**Figure 8:** Topographical map of Europe displayed in Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection.

The names of the countries have been added (for credits see Figure 7).\n\n(Note: The map provided is only a 2-D model of the real configuration, i.e. the altitude of the satellites above the ground is neglected.)\n\nIn the first step, the students use information on their worksheets to determine their approximate location. The signal travel times in the worksheet table (see Table 1) deviate contain an offset from the correct time, simulating a GPS receiver clock that is several milliseconds fast.\n\n<br/>\n**Instructions**<br/>\nThe time the signals take to reach to you is given in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 s).\n\nRadio signals are transmitted at the speed of light, so you only have to use the constant value of that speed (c = 299792.458 km/s) to convert the time into a distance. \n\n*Example:* <br/>\nLet us assume that the measured signal travel time is 10 ms (milliseconds). The measured distance to the satellite can be calculated as follows:\n\n\u0394s = c \u2022 \u0394t<br/>\n\n\u0394s: distance to the satellite<br/>\nc: speed of light<br/>\n\u0394t: signal travel time<br/>\n\n\u0394s = 299792.458 km/s \u2022 10 ms = 299792.458 km/s \u2022 0.01 s = 2997.92 km\n\nInstruct the students to always translate the time from milliseconds into seconds.\n\n*What is the scale of the map?*<br/>\nThe first step is to determine the scale of the map. This should be done as accurately as possible. There is a line indicating 300 km. Important: Do not change the scale of the map in the worksheets. It indicates that 300 km on land correspond to 13 mm on the map.\n\n*How far away are the satellites?*<br/>\nExplain that the students should use the table on the worksheet (Table 1) by filling in the missing numbers. For this part of the activity, only the columns labelled \u2018measured\u2019 will be used. The columns labelled \u2018corrected\u2019 are only needed for the additional activity for advanced students (see below).\n\n**Table 1: Table as provided in Worksheet 2.**\n<br/>\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/Table 1.png)\n\nNow, the students are supposed to determine the distances the signals have travelled from the time displayed on the receiver (see table). Minding the units, the times have to be multiplied by the constant speed of light (299792.458 km/s). The calculated values are entered under the column \u2018Distance (km), measured\u2019.\n\nUsing the scale of the map, the students convert this distance to the one on the map. As mentioned before, 300 km on Earth correspond to 13 mm on the map. This value is then added under the column \u2018Distance on map (cm), measured\u2019. The resulting values are given in Table 2.\n\nThe students then use their compasses and draw circles or arcs with radii equal to the signal travel lengths. With each additional arc, the students are supposed to determine the countries they are in.\n\nQuestion: What do you notice about your likely position with each additional satellite signal arc?<br/>\nAnswer: With each additional satellite arc, the position is determined with a higher precision.\n\nAfter drawing the arc for the last satellite, the students will see that the four arcs do not intersect in a single point, but in an area that should include the true location (Figure 9). This is due to the problems in the receiver clock. The correct position is somewhere in the area enclosed by the intersections.\n\nQuestion: What are the possible countries of your current position?<br/> \nAnswer: Possible solutions are the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and Germany.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/GPS_Sheet_Satellites.png)\n**Figure 9:** Topographical map of Europe displayed in Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection. The arcs represent the distances that the signals have travelled from the four satellites in the times specified in the table of Worksheet 2 (for credits see Figure 7).\n\n<br/>\nTo determine the location more precisely, e.g. in order to be prepared for the extension activity below, a single point must be identified that represents the true location. Two approximations can be used for this.\n\n*Simple solution*<br/>\nThe centre of mass of the resulting area of intersection can be estimated by guessing a point that has the same distance from all four intersections of pairs of arcs. It should be in the southern part of the Netherlands.\n\n*Advanced solution*<br/>\nIn real life, GPS receivers change the time offset common to all receiving signals until a point of intersection is found or the location is narrowed down to an small area. This algorithm can be simplified in this example by approximating the centre of mass graphically. The common area is surrounded by four arcs. The students have to determine the bisectors for each of them. Then, they connect the opposing bisectors with lines. This results in two crossing lines whose intersection can be defined as the centre of mass (Figure 6). It is a good approximation of the true location. Again, the location should be in the southern part of the Netherlands (Figure 10).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/GPS_Sheet_Satellites_interpolated.png)\n**Figure 10:** The same map as before, but this time with the approximation for the simulated location (for credits see Figure 7).\n\n###**EXTENSION FOR ADVANCED STUDENTS: CORRECTING THE CLOCK**\nQuestion: What is the reason for the mismatch between the distances derived from the GPS measurements and the location determined by interpolation?<br/>\nAnswer: The clock of the GPS receiver is incorrect.\n\nIn a real GPS receiver, this interpolated position is used to calculate a correction for the satellites. This is then assumed for subsequent positioning. This additional activity illustrates these calculations and determines the offset of the receiver clock.\n\nAfter determining the centre of mass of the area of intersection (Figure 10), the students measure its distance to each of the satellites on the map. The values are added to the table on their worksheets in the column labelled \u2018Distance on map (cm), corrected\u2019. These numbers are then converted into true distances using the map scale and added to the table in column \u2018Distance (km), corrected\u2019.\n\nThe corrected signal travel times for each of the satellites are calculated using the speed of light and added to column \u2018Signal travel time (ms), corrected\u2019. With this, the students calculate the difference between the initial value given by the simulated GPS receiver and the corrected one. These differences are added to the column \u2018Correction (ms), meas-corr\u2019. From the resulting four differences, the students derive the average. This is the clock correction the simulated GPS receiver would have to apply to any additional measurements. The resulting numbers would be similar to the ones in Table 2.\n\n\n**Table 2: Table with results.**\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/60c1eda3-fc1b-44b9-a8b1-bfee5d17300c/Table 2.png)\n\nNote that due to uncertainties introduced by the drawing on the map, the numbers can vary a bit.\n\n", "curriculum": "**Germany**<br/>\n\nCountry/ Fed.

Questo consente agli studenti di avere un esempio, e mostra anche che l'insegnante voglia prendersi dei rischi creativi.\n\n### Passo 4\nPreparate i vostri strumenti. Se gli studenti hanno portato i propri, assicuratevi che siano disponibili. Se siete stati voi a procurarli, distribuiteli alla classe (permettete agli studenti di scegliere, e date agli studenti circa un minuto per sperimentare con gli strumenti scelti). Se avete uno strumento che passa a turno, chiedete a uno studente di offrirsi volontario per primo e passategli lo strumento.\n\n### Passo 5\nInvitate gli studenti a fare a turno, creando 15-30 secondi di improvvisazione basata sull'immagine. Gli altri studenti possono provare a spiegare come la musica si collega all'immagine. Dopo che alcuni studenti hanno fornito le spiegazioni, lo studente che ha creato l'improvvisazione pu\u00f2 spiegare il proprio pensiero su come la musica si rapporta con i fenomeni scientifici raffigurati nell'immagine.\n\n### Passo 6\nLo studente che ha appena improvvisato seleziona il successivo (e passa lo strumento se necessario). Questo aggiunge un elemento di sorpresa; nessuno sa chi \u00e8 il prossimo. Fatelo diventare un gioco!\n\n### Passo 7\nUna volta che tutti gli studenti hanno improvvisato, considerate altri modi per prolungare l'attivit\u00e0, se il tempo lo permette. Invitate gli studenti a creare altre improvvisazioni aggiuntive basate su aspetti dell'immagine che non hanno ancora analizzato, o sfidate gli studenti a creare improvvisazioni completamente diverse dal loro primo tentativo.

Younger students might not need the detailed thermodynamic equations.\n\n###**INTRODUCTION**\nIntroduce the role of the Sun as the main heat source of the Earth, along the following discussion and questions.\n\nQ: We experience day and night and the different seasons. What causes the different temperatures when the seasons change?<br/>\nA: The Sun\u2019s heating.\n\nQ: How much of the Earth\u2019s surface is covered by water and how much by land (approximately)?<br/>\nA: About 71% is covered by water.\n\nQ: So, between land and oceans, what is the heated the most by insolation?<br/>\nA: The oceans.\n\nQ: In the deserts, the temperature changes between day and night are very strong. Can you imagine why?<br/>\nA: The solid surface absorbs heat and gets warm quickly. If something heats up very rapidly, it also cools down at a very high rate. In addition, deserts usually lack the \u2018blanket\u2019 of clouds that blocks the heat from warming the Earth.\n\nQ: In comparison, how rapidly does water respond to heating? Imagine a pot of water on a stove.<br/>\nA: This is a rather slow process.\n\n###**EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP 1**\nIt would be best if the students worked in groups of two to share responsibilities. They will measure the temperature changes of water and soil heated by a lamp over time. To ensure similar conditions for both substances, the experiment is carried out in two steps. \n\n1.\tFill one tray with water and the other with soil or sand. The quantities should be the same.\n2.\tPlace the tray filled with water below the lamp.\n3.\tImmerse the tip of the thermometer in the water. Its orientation should be as parallel as possible to the angle of irradiation. This grazing angle helps to reduce the direct heating of the thermometer.\n4.\tLet the substances assume room temperature.\n5.\tIn the meantime, prepare a data table for filling in the measurements. It should allow for 21 lines of data and four columns (see Table 1).\n6.\tThe first column lists numbers from 0 to 20 (minutes).\n\n**Table 1: First lines of the data table, including the header.**\n\nTime t (min) | Water \u03d1 (\u00b0C) | Soil \u03d1 (\u00b0C) | Difference \u0394\u03d1 (\u00b0C)\n--- | --- | --- \n0 |  |  |  \n1 |  |  |  \n\u22ee |  |  |\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/15bfe10b-8eef-4b3d-b266-12af717b9c0b/ExpSetUp_1.png)\n**Figure 5:** Experimental set-up for the temperature measurement of water. A petri dish is filled with water, and a thermometer is ready to measure the temperature. In order to maintain the thermometer in an upright position, it is attached to the frame with a pin and a paper clip. The lamp is set to illuminate the dish (own work).\n\nQ: What do you think: how do the temperatures change after switching on the lamp?<br/>\nA: The temperature rises as long as the lamp is on. When it is switched off, the water will cool down again.\n\nQ: After examining the water, you will use soil. Do you expect a different temperature response?<br/>\nA: The rates of heating and cooling will be different.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/15bfe10b-8eef-4b3d-b266-12af717b9c0b/ExpSetUp_2.png)\n**Figure 6:** While illuminating the water, the temperature is read from the thermometer every minute (own work).\n\n\n<br/>\n**Experimental procedure 1**<br/>\nThe procedure is the same for both experiments. Begin with water.\n1.\tTake the first temperature measurement before switching on the lamp.\n2.\tStart the stop watch and switch on the lamp (Figure 6).\n3.\tFor 10 minutes, take a measurement every minute and note down the value in the corresponding row in the table.\n4.\tAfter 10 minutes, switch off the lamp and continue measuring the temperature as before.\n5.\tStop measuring after 20 minutes. You should have 10 temperature readings with the light switched on and 10 with the light switched off.\n6.\tReplace the water tray with the one filled with soil.\n\n**Analysis 1**<br/>\nThe data are analysed by producing a diagram that shows the time elapsed during the experiment vs. the temperatures measured.\n\nWhile one of the students of any working group continues to fill the data into diagram (Figure 7), the other prepares the second experiment with the soil.\n\n1.\tPrepare a diagram (e.g. Figure 7, upper panel) with two axes. The horizontal axis lists the time elapsed during the experiment, while the vertical axis lists the temperatures. Be prepared for a temperature range between 20 and 35\u00b0C.\n2.\tWhile the thermometer assumes room temperature again, enter the data into the diagram. For each measurement, add a small cross at the coordinate that matches the time and the temperature.\n3.\tConnect the data points of the diagram.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/15bfe10b-8eef-4b3d-b266-12af717b9c0b/T_vs_t_empty.png)\n**Figure 7**: Template for the diagram to record the temperature measurements. The upper panel will contain the temporal changes in temperature. The lower panel is reserved for plotting the difference between the soil and water temperatures. Use different colours to represent the data (own work).\n\n\n###**EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP 2**\nLet the students prepare the second experiment in the same way as the first (Figure 8). Instead of water, the students will examine the soil (dirt, sand).\n\n<br/>\n**Experimental procedure 2**<br/>\nThe procedure is the same as before.\n1.\tTake the first temperature measurement before switching on the lamp.\n2.\tStart the stop watch and switch on the lamp.\n3.\tFor 10 minutes, take a measurement every minute and note down the value in corresponding row in the table.\n4.\tAfter 10 minutes, switch off the lamp and continue measuring the temperature as before.\n5.\tStop measuring after 20 minutes. You should have 10 temperatures with the light switched on and 10 with the light switched off.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/15bfe10b-8eef-4b3d-b266-12af717b9c0b/ExpSetUp_3.png)\n**Figure 8:** The set-up of the second experiment is the same as for the one with water, but this time the petri dish is filled with dirt, sand, or soil (own work).\n\n<br/>\n**Analysis 2**\n1.\tAs before, add the new data to the diagram.\n2.\tConnect the data points.\n3.\tIn the diagram, indicate the ranges, when the lamp was switched on and when it was switched off.\n4.\tFor each time step, calculate the temperature difference and add it to the table.\n5.\tPrepare a second diagram that shows the temporal evolution of that difference.\n6.\tFill that diagram with the corresponding data.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/15bfe10b-8eef-4b3d-b266-12af717b9c0b/T_vs_t.png)\n**Figure 9:** Sample changes in the temperatures of water (blue) and soil (red). The black curve below depicts the difference between the two temperatures (not revealed to the students in the worksheet, own work).\n\n###**HINTS FOR MODIFYING THE ACTIVITY**\nInstead of freshwater, one may use saltwater to investigate differences between them.\n\nIf you use a petri dish that provides two reservoirs (as shown in the images), you may be able to set up the experiment such that both measurements can be recorded simultaneously. However, It may be difficult to position the lamp such that it irradiates both samples equally. This set-up was not tested. So, it is recommended to try it first before modifying the activity.\n\n###**CONCLUSION**\nDescribe and discuss the results with your group members or classmates.\n\nQ: How did the temperatures change while the lamp was switched on and off?<br/>\nA: The temperature rises while the substances were illuminated, and they cooled down as soon as the lamp was off.\n\nQ: Do you recognise a difference between the two substances?<br/>\nA: The water heats up less and more slowly.\n\n**Remark:** It should also cool down more slowly. However, the particular conditions of the experimental set-up may influence the cooling process, e.g. high room temperature.\n\nQ: The temperatures rose differently. What is causing this? What changed between the experiments?<br/>\nA: Everything stayed the same, except the substance to be probed. The observed difference must be caused by the properties of the substances.\n\nQ: Imagine now the Earth with its oceans and continents. Describe how these components react to solar irradiation.<br/>\nA: During daytime, the half of the Earth facing the Sun is irradiated, and its land masses and water are heated. During the night, the heat is released. Further, oceans warm up and cool down more slowly than continents.\n\nQ: Can you determine the role the oceans have in the global climatic system? Think of what would happen to global temperatures without oceans.<br/>\nA: The oceans have a dampening effect on the global warming, as they can store heat that otherwise would lead to higher global temperatures.\n\nQ: What happens to the oceans, if the heating rate rises, while the cooling rate stays the same?<br/>\nA: The temperature rises.\n", "curriculum": "**Germany**<br/>\n\nCountry/ Fed.

Each reservoir serves as both a source of and a sink for carbon, as indicated by opposing arrows. The carbon released by burning fossil fuels is an unbalanced contribution to the global carbon budget. The total carbon from burning of fossil fuels has increased from 5.5 Gt to 7-8 Gt between 2003 and 2007 (NASA/AIRS, https://www.flickr.com/photos/atmospheric-infrared-sounder/8265010034, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode)\n\n<br/>\nCarbon is altered chemically and its compounds attain different physical states. Usually, the exchange of carbon between the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the biosphere and the atmosphere is maintained in a delicate and naturally balanced equilibrium, with carbon sources and carbon sinks being in constant interaction. Sinks and sources are defined as subsystems that capture carbon or release it into the atmosphere where they act as greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methane.\n\n**Table 1: Natural and artificial carbon sources and sinks.**<br/>\n\nCarbon sources | Carbon sinks \n--- |\nVolcanoes | Oceans and Lakes\nOrganic decay | Vegetation by photosynthesis \nNatural forest/ bush fires | Reforestation \nFossil fuel production and combustion | Precipitation \nDeforestation by fire clearing | Industrial production of atmospheric gases \nWaste incineration | Carbon capture and storage methods \nGas hydrates | \nWaters | \nLivestock | \nRice farming | \nManure management | \nWaste management | \nIndustrial manufacturing | \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/CarbonSinksSources.png)\n**Figure 2:** Evolution of the budget of carbon sinks and sources (climatesafety, https://www.flickr.com/photos/\nclimatesafety/4745854611, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/> \nHowever, human activities constantly increase the imbalance in carbon sources, leading to a growing concentration of carbon-based greenhouse gases. As Figure 3 illustrates, the amount of atmospheric CO2 has increased dramatically since the beginning of the 20th century. The growth rate is unprecedented for the recent several hundred thousand years. There is a broad consensus among climatologists that this contributes significantly to the global warming seen today. Carbon dioxide concentrations can be measured both by sensors on ground and with dedicated Earth observation probes from space by remote sensing. Successful space programmes for monitoring greenhouse gases globally are Europe\u2019s Envisat, Japan\u2019s GoSat as well as NASA\u2019s OCO-2 satellite. Europe\u2019s Copernicus programme with its Sentinel satellites will also help understand the effects of increasing levels of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/203_co2-graph-021116_crop.jpeg)\n**Figure 3:** This graph, based on the comparison of atmospheric samples contained in ice cores and more recent direct measurements, provides evidence that atmospheric CO2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution until February 2016.

Its value represents the concentration of free hydron (\"H\" ^+) or hydronium (\"H\" _3 \"O\" ^+) ions. The value is defined as:\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/Equation 1.png)\n\n\nThe concentration of hydronium ions c(H3O<sup>+</sup> is given in units of moles per litre. The mole is a standard unit for the amount of a given substance. pH indicators change their colour depending on the pH value of the solution. This helps measure the pH value.\n\n<br/>\n**Oceans as a carbon sink**<br/>\nUp to 30-40% of manmade carbon dioxide is captured in oceans, rivers and lakes. The gas efficiently dissolves in water. Therefore, oceans are a very powerful and significant carbon sink.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/CO2_pump_hg.svg.png)\n**Figure 4:** Air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide (McSush (modified), Hannes Grobe (original), https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CO2_pump_hg.svg, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nAlthough the ability of water to capture and store CO<sub>2</sub> helps reduce greenhouse gases, it comes at a high price. The dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> in water changes its chemistry. As a result, the water becomes more acidic. The acidification and its consequences can be split up into three chemical reactions. First, carbon dioxide and water form carbonic acid.\n\nCO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>\n\nThe acid is immediately split up into its ions, one of which is the hydron ion that reacts to form the hydronium ion H3O<sup>+</sup>. The free hydron or hydronium ions are characteristic of an acid. This is reflected in the definition of the pH value (see above).\n\nH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>\n  \u2192 H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\n\nThe acidic solution reacts with carbonate ions that are abundant in ocean water. They are the building blocks e.g. for the exoskeletons of shellfish like snails, mussels as well as corals.\n\nH<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>-</sup> \u2192 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>\n\nThese reactions occur at the surface of water bodies like the oceans. As a result, the formation of carbonate compounds like lime is hindered, or in extreme cases, existing exoskeletons can even get dissolved. The net equation of the reaction chain is shown in Figure 5.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/Ocean-acidification_chem.jpg)\n**Figure 5:** Illustration of how CO2 dissolved in water consumes carbonate ions. It impedes calcification or may even lead to decalcification of sea shells (NOAA PMEL Carbon program, NAOO public domain).\n\n<br/>\nAlthough the salinity of sea water mitigates the effect of acidification, the tendency remains. Apart from in-situ sample measurements, new technologies are available to determine ocean pH levels on a global scale using remote sensing from Earth observation satellites (Figure 6).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/Surface_ocean_pH.jpg)\n**Figure 6:** This map shows the first estimates of surface ocean pH using salinity data from ESA\u2019s SMOS with satellite sea-surface temperature measurements and additional auxiliary data. There is a spatial variation of the pH across the globe. Cold waters near the poles tend to be more acidic because of the ability of cold water to better dissolve carbon dioxide than warm water (ESA/R. Sabia, http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2015/01/Surface_ocean_pH, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/igo/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nSuch maps also indicate that polar regions are more strongly affected by acidification than others. This is because cold water can better dissolve CO2 than warm water. Wide range water currents are known to connect the oceans of the world. As a consequence, water is exchanged between latitudes. So acidic, i.e. CO2 rich water, is transported from the poles to the equator regions. The water gets heated on its way and releases part of the stored CO2. Therefore, oceans can also be regarded as a regionally confined carbon source.\n\nThis influence of water temperatures has also been confirmed by data models that capture the past and projected evolution of global pH levels, as shown in the climate reports of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, see Figure 7). All projections show a stronger acidification of the polar regions than other regions on Earth.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/IPCC2013-Fig6-28_reordered.jpg)\n**Figure 7:** Past and projected evolution of oceanic surface pH levels. The models were calculated for the most optimistic (RCP2.6, Representative Concentration Pathways) and the most pessimistic scenarios (RCP8.5) for the evolution of atmospheric CO2.

Several species grow exoskeletons with carbonatic structures (corals, sea snails, mussels, etc.). These carbonates, mostly limestone, dissolve under the influence of carbonic acid. For example, sea snails, also known as sea butterflies, are one of the victims of acidification (Figure 8). Their shell becomes more fragile, which for them is a life-threatening situation. Experiments have even shown that such creatures lose most of their shells after exposure to acidification levels expected in the near future. Since they are the basis of an entire food chain, their extinction may have a tremendous impact on a large portion of marine life.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/Pterapod_shell_dissolved_in_seawa_hKAfOK4.jpg)\n**Figure 8:** In laboratory experiments, the shell of this sea snail dissolved over the course of 45 days in seawater adjusted to an ocean chemistry projected for the year 2100 (Credit: NOAA Environmental Visualization Laboratory (EVL), https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pterapod_shell_dissolved_in_seawater_adjusted_to_an_ocean_chemistry_projected_for_the_year_2100.jpg, public domain).\n\n<br/>\nAnother example is microscopic, single-cell algae called coccolithophores (Figure 9). They form shells that consist of calcium carbonate scales. After they die, they sink to the sea floor. This process removes carbon from the global carbon cycle. If the formation of the carbonate shell is impeded, this carbon sink becomes less effective.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/Emiliania_huxleyi_coccolithophore_nwFahjz.png)\n**Figure 9:** Image of a single coccolithophore cell produced with a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Credit: Alison R.

Each compound contains carbon atoms.\n\nQuestion: What substances do you know that contain carbon?<br/> \nPossible answers: coal, petrol, fuel, pencils, sugar, carbon dioxide, methane, \u2026\n\nQuestion: Do you know solid, liquid or gaseous substances that contain carbon?<br/> \nPossible answers: (see above)\n\nQuestion: What is simplest gas that contains carbon and that is a product of combustion or organic decay? You even exhale it when breathing.<br/>\nAnswer: carbon dioxide (CO2)\n\nThe atmosphere of the Earth contains carbon dioxide whose level is constantly rising.\n\nQuestion: What happens when carbon dioxide gets dissolved in water, as it happens with the oceans on Earth?<br/> \nPossible answers: carbonated water, enriches water with carbonic acid\n\nThis is what we will find out with the next activity. It turns into an acid.\n\nQuestion: What do acids do?<br/> \nPossible answers: They can dissolve material.\n\nInformation:<br/> \nThe strength of an acid is measured by its pH value. The scale runs from 1 to 14. A neutral substance that is neither an acid nor a lye has values close to 7. The lower the value, the stronger the acid is. High values indicate lye. The pH value can be measured with indicators that change colour accordingly.\n\n\n###**ACTIVITY 1**\n**List of Material**<br/> \nThe number of items corresponds to the number of students carrying out the experiments. One set consists of:\n\n- Distilled or demineralised water\n- Transparent cup or glass\n- Straw\n- Universal pH indicator according to McCrumb\n(provided with the activity package)\n- As an alternative: pH indicator made from red cabbage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG-pNRVHsc4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMXMlWybv8A\n\nHand out the items to the students. Let them perform the following tasks step by step. Warn them not to swallow the liquid.\n\n**Step 1:** Pour some water in the glass.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/activity1-1.jpg)\n**Figure 10:** Items required for the first part of the activity.\n\n<br/>\n**Step 2:** Add a few drops of the indicator until the solution turns green.\n\nQuestion: What is the pH value of the liquid? Is it acidic or basic?<br/>\nAnswer: The pH value is 8, which means the water is neutral or slightly basic.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/activity1-2.jpg)\n**Figure 11:** The water after the addition of some pH indicator has a pH value of 8.\n\n<br/>\n**Step 3:** Use the straw und blow gently into the solution. Take care that it does not spill out of the glass. Continue until the colour of the indicator stops changing.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/activity1-3.jpg)\n**Figure 12:** Blowing air into the liquid introduces carbon dioxide, which slowly changes the pH value.\n\n<br/>\n**Step 4:** Compare the final colour with the pH table of the indicator and determine the pH value.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/activity1-4.jpg)\n**Figure 13:** After blowing for several minutes, the colour stops changing. In this example, a pH value of 3 was reached. This indicates that the liquid changed to acidic carbonated water.\n\n\n<br/>\nQuestion: What is the pH value you reached? Did the water become acidic or basic?<br/>\nAnswer: The pH value is \u2026 (3 in the example given in Figure 14). This is quite acidic.\n\nQuestion: What do acids do with other substances?<br/>\nAnswer: Acids have the power to dissolve certain substances.\n\nInformation:<br/>\nIn this case, the students produced carbonic acid. In nature, the products react with limestone, which chemically is calcium carbonate. It is the building block of the exoskeletons of many marine creatures like sea snails, mussels or corals.\n\nIn order to show the impact of ocean acidification by CO2, let the students watch the following videos:\n\nThe Other Carbon Dioxide Problem (Duration: 3:57)\nhttps://youtu.be/9EaLRcVdTbM\n\nSea Change: The Pacific\u2019s perilous turn (Duration: 9:03)\nhttps://goo.gl/Hu5y4q\n\nQuestion: What happens to marine creatures with exoskeletons made of limestone, when the water becomes more acidic?<br/>\nPossible answers: The limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid.\n\n\n###**ACTIVITY 2**\n\nQuestion: Do you know how to neutralise the solution, i.e. change the acid into neutral water again? The teacher can help by explaining that the gas in sparkling water and sodas is carbon dioxide too. What happens to them when keeping them open at room temperature for a while?<br/>\nPossible answers: drive out the carbon dioxide by waiting for a long time or support by heating\n\nThe following experiment can be carried out as a demonstration by the teacher, if there is the possibility that the students might hurt themselves when heating the solution. Otherwise, hand out heaters or stoves and turn them on.\n\nPut the glass with the acidic solution on the heater. After heating it for several minutes, the liquid starts to change colours. Avoid boiling! Eventually, the colour should turn to green, indicating neutralisation. The different shades of the colour are shown in Figure 14.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9904adae-f782-4792-883d-7bd46df41bc1/activity2-1.jpg)\n**Figure 14:** On heating the acidic liquid, the colour starts to change again. The acidification is reversed because carbon dioxide is driven out of the liquid. Warm water cannot store as much carbon dioxide as water at lower temperatures.\n\n<br/>\nQuestion: Do you see a change while heating the solution?<br/>\nAnswer: Yes, the colour changes.\n\nQuestion: What is the pH value you reached?<br/>\nAnswer: The pH is back to a neutral value of 7 or 8.\n\nQuestion: What happens to ocean water when it is transported from polar to equatorial regions?<br/>\nAnswers: It heats up.\n\nQuestion: Which waters can store more carbon dioxide? Polar or equatorial?<br/>\nAnswers: Polar\n\nQuestion: So, what happens to the carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean?<br/>\nAnswer: It is released into the atmosphere.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "\nThe students turn neutral water into a carbonic acid by introducing carbon dioxide by blowing into the solution. Afterwards, they neutralise the solution by heating, which releases the dissolved carbon dioxide. This experiment is an analogy of what happens to water when it is exposed to the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, i.e. it absorbs the gas and becomes more acidic. This is a threat to marine species like corals and snails who develop exoskeletons by building limestone structures. Limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid. In the end, the students see that warm water can store less carbon dioxide which in turn is less acidic. However, ocean water is transported from polar to low latitude regions. On its way, it releases carbon dioxide that cannot be stored as the water gets heated.\n\n", "alert_message": "", "short_desc_material": "There are 2 attachments: Worksheet editable and Worksheet PDF.

Nell'emisfero Sud, invece, tutte le stelle si muovono attorno ad un'area molto buia chiamata \"Nebulosa Sacco di Carbone\". Oggigiorno, la Stella Polare mostra sempre la direzione del vero nord ed \u00e8 visibile solo nell\u2019emisfero Nord. La nebulosa Sacco di Carbone mostra la direzione del sud ed \u00e8 visibile solo nell\u2019emisfero Sud.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/1.jpg)\n\nLe costellazioni sono una sorta di schemi di stelle che formano delle figure immaginarie e che sembrano sempre nella stessa posizione l'una rispetto all'altra. La Stella Polare \u00e8 una delle stelle presenti nella coda della costellazione dell'Orsa Minore. Puoi vedere l'Orsa Maggiore, Cassiopea e l'Orsa Minore, insieme ad altre nel cielo. Se infatti guardi il cielo notturno da un posto buio le vedrai facilmente. La pi\u00f9 difficile da trovare \u00e8 l\u2019Orsa Minore perch\u00e9 la luce delle sue stelle \u00e8 debole. Inizia a cercare l'Orsa Maggiore e Cassiopea. Dopo di che puoi cercare l'Orsa Minore utilizzando la posizione delle tre costellazioni come nel diagramma. Se guardi queste costellazioni di nuovo un\u2019ora pi\u00f9 tardi, vedrai che hanno leggermente ruotato attorno alla Stella Polare.\n\n**Dov'\u00e8 il Sole**\n\nGuardando verso l'orizzonte e conoscendo le direzioni dell\u2019alba e del tramonto, possiamo dire in che direzione ci stiamo muovendo. Se vuoi tornare indietro dovrai semplicemente girarti e andare nella direzione opposta. Questo \u00e8 facile quando siamo a terra: abbiamo solo bisogno di tenere fissi uno o due punti nell\u2019orizzonte e andare nella direzione opposta, cambiando i punti di riferimento di destra a sinistra e i punti di sinistra a destra. Ovviamente, con una bussola si pu\u00f2 pi\u00f9 facilmente dire in quale direzione \u00e8 il nord, il sud e gli altri punti cardinali. Tuttavia \u00e8 anche possibile trovare la strada senza l'utilizzo di una bussola, perch\u00e9 per esempio, in Portogallo il sole di mezzogiorno \u00e8 sempre verso sud.\n\n**La posizione del Sole durante il giorno**\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/2.jpg)\n\nAlba ad est - Tramonto a ovest\n\n*La posizione del Sole nell'emisfero settentrionale sopra il Tropico del Cancro*\n\nTrovare la strada di notte, nel deserto o in mare \u00e8 pi\u00f9 difficile poich\u00e9 non abbiamo punti di riferimento sull'orizzonte. Nell'emisfero settentrionale, la Stella Polare \u00e8 sempre a nord ed \u00e8 visibile di notte. Quindi se ci giriamo verso la Stella Polare, il Sole sorger\u00e0 sempre alla nostra destra e tramonter\u00e0 alla nostra sinistra. Se vivi a Capo Verde, che si trova tra il Tropico del Cancro e l'Equatore, la Stella Polare a nord \u00e8 ancora visibile. Tuttavia, in base alla stagione, il sole di mezzogiorno pu\u00f2 essere verso nord o verso sud rispetto alla tua posizione. Se viaggiassimo verso l'emisfero Sud della Terra, come i navigatori portoghesi del 15esimo secolo, non vedremo pi\u00f9 la Stella Polare, ma la nebulosa Sacco di Carbone ci mostrer\u00e0 sempre la via verso sud.\n\nCi sono diversi modi per trovare il polo Nord e il polo Sud. Per esempio, nell'emisfero settentrionale trovare Cassiopea \u00e8 importante ma non necessario. Vedi: http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070108.html\nNell'emisfero meridionale ci sono almeno quattro metodi diversi per trovare il polo Sud, vedi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole#Finding_the_south_celestial_pole.\n\n**Alcuni strumenti per la navigazione**\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/3.jpg)\n\nIl quadrante \u00e8 uno strumento sviluppato da Tolomeo e pi\u00f9 tardi migliorato dagli astronomi musulmani. I navigatori lo usavano per misurare la loro latitudine. Si guardava verso una stella attraverso il mirino e si teneva il quadrante fino a quando il piano si trovava in posizione verticale. L'altezza della Stella Polare misurata con un quadrante corrisponde alla tua latitudine se sei nell'emisfero settentrionale. I navigatori usavano lo strumento anche con l'altezza del centro del Sole e lo puntavano di fronte a loro, con il Sole a lato, per evitare di doverlo guardare direttamente.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/4.jpg)\n\n**Latitudine**\n\nOsservando il Sole e la regolarit\u00e0 della rotazione terrestre attorno al Sole, gli astronomi e i geografi sono riusciti a trovare dei modi pratici per determinare la nostra posizione sulla Terra.\n\nLe posizioni a nord e a sud dell'equatore sono segnate lungo delle linee parallele circolari disegnate attorno alla Terra. Queste linee sono chiamate paralleli e le loro posizioni sono misurate in gradi: l'Equatore \u00e8 la linea a zero gradi, il Polo Nord \u00e8 a 90\u00b0 N rispetto all'Equatore e il Polo Sud giace a 90\u00b0 S rispetto all'Equatore. La misura della posizione nord/sud \u00e8 chiamata latitudine.\n\nPer determinare la latitudine di una localit\u00e0 durante il giorno, oltre a conoscere l'angolo del sole di mezzogiorno sopra l'orizzonte, la data, la tua posizione approssimativa sulla Terra, hai anche bisogno di sapere se sei nell'emisfero Nord o Sud e la tua posizione relativa ai tropici. Nell'emisfero Nord l'angolo della Stella Polare al di sopra dell'orizzonte \u00e8 la latitudine della tua posizione. La latitudine di un luogo \u00e8 la misura dell'angolo se viaggi dall'Equatore verso il parallelo che passa attraverso questo luogo, perpendicolare all'Equatore. A qualsiasi ora della notte, questo angolo \u00e8 uguale all'angolo della Stella Polare al di sopra dell'orizzonte. Misurare la latitudine \u00e8 facile, perch\u00e9 nell'emisfero Nord, la Stella Polare \u00e8 sempre visibile nel cielo notturno.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/5.jpg)\n\n**Longitudine**\n\nLa latitudine fornisce informazioni solo su una parte della posizione su un mappamondo. Per dare un'informazione completa sulla posizione di un luogo, abbiamo bisogno di usare un secondo riferimento che mostra la posizione orizzontale su una sfera.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/6.jpg)\n\nI meridiani o le linee di longitudine collegano i poli Nord e Sud, come i segmenti di un mandarino. Ciascun meridiano attraversa la linea equatoriale. Poich\u00e9 l'equatore \u00e8 un cerchio, possiamo dividerlo in 360\u00b0. Per ragioni storiche, dal 1884, il conto dei meridiani inizia con la linea che attraversa il *Royal Observatory* di Greenwich, a Londra (UK).  Esso \u00e8 conosciuto come il primo meridiano, dove la longitudine \u00e8 0\u00b0. Muovendosi verso est del Primo Meridiano, la longitudine \u00e8 misurata in gradi fino a 180\u00b0, per esempio Parigi ha una longitudine di 2.4\u00b0 E. Analogamente muovendosi verso ovest, la longitudine \u00e8 misurata in gradi ovest, per esempio Lisbona ha una longitudine di 9.1\u00b0 W. Se conosciamo la latitudine e la longitudine di un posto, possiamo localizzarlo su una sfera.\n\nLatitudine e Longitudine sono dette coordinate.\n\n**Unit\u00e0 di longitudine e latitudine**\n\nSia la longitudine che la latitudine sono misurate in gradi. Per una localit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 specifica, si possono usare anche frazioni di gradi. Alternativamente, in modo simile alle ore, i gradi possono essere suddivisi in arcominuti (') e arcosecondi (\"), con 60' in un grado e 60\" in un arcominuto. Quindi l'inclinazione terrestre, 23\u00b030' \u00e8 uguale a 23.5\u00b0. Questo esercizio usa le frazioni di un grado.", "fulldesc": "###Attivit\u00e0 1: La nostra posizione sulla Terra: latitudine\n\n###Passo 1:\nGli studenti devono trovare la loro citt\u00e0 sul mappamondo.

L'applicazione pu\u00f2 farlo in base alla tua posizione o puoi digitare la tua posizione (o la posizione della citt\u00e0 pi\u00f9 vicina).\n\n###Passo 2:\nSe c'\u00e8 un dispositivo per classe, chiedi a un volontario di localizzare la Stella Polare se sei nell'emisfero Nord o la Nebulosa Sacco di Carbone se sei nell'emisfero Sud.\n\n###Passo 3:\nLo studente ruota e muove il dispositivo fino a quando non trova la Stella Polare o la Nebulosa Sacco di Carbone. Usa la bussola inclusa nell'applicazione oppure un altro studente pu\u00f2 usare una bussola per trovare Nord e Sud. I modi per localizzare questi oggetti sono inclusi nelle informazioni di *background*.\n\n###Passo 4:\nUna volta che hai localizzato l'oggetto chiedi loro di puntare il dispositivo nella stessa direzione.\n\n###Passo 5:\nChiedi ad un secondo studente di misurare l\u2019angolo della Stella Polare o della Nebulosa Sacco di Carbone rispetto al pavimento/orizzonte con un goniometro. Alternativamente se hai un quadrante, la vista del cielo notturno pu\u00f2 essere presentata su uno schermo verticale e gli studenti guardano attraverso un quadrante per misurare l\u2019angolo dell\u2019oggetto sopra l\u2019orizzonte. Questa attivit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 anche usare un quadrante per guardare il vero cielo notturno in una notte con il cielo limpido.\n\n###Passo 6:\nGli studenti annotano l'angolo da loro trovato (questo angolo \u00e8 la latitudine del posto in cui ti trovi).\n\n###Passo 7:\nChiedi agli studenti se tutti vedono la Stella Polare (o la Nebulosa Sacco di Carbone) allo stesso angolo.

Arriva alla conclusione che le persone nell'emisfero Nord possono vedere la Stella Polare (e le persone nell\u2019emisfero sud non possono) ma fallo vedere a diversi angoli in base al posto in cui si trovano (o l'equivalente con l'emisfero sud e la Nebulosa Sacco di Carbone).

Anche se conoscessimo quanto siamo a Nord o a Sud, possiamo ancora essere ovunque lungo la stessa linea parallela, per esempio Nizza in Francia e Toronto in Canada sono entrambi a latitudine 43.7\u00b0 ma sono molto distanti l\u2019una dall\u2019altra.\n\n###Passo 2:\nChiedi agli studenti di dire/indicare la posizione di due diverse citt\u00e0 sul mappamondo. Secondo loro \u00e8 necessario un altro pezzo di informazione per distinguere le due citt\u00e0? In cosa sono differenti?\n\n###Passo 3:\nArriva alla conclusione che la posizione orizzontale sulla terra, ovvero l'Est-Ovest, \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che le differenzia. Spiega che dividiamo la terra usando linee dal Polo Nord al Polo Sud, come i segmenti di un mandarino. Chiedi agli studenti di individuare queste linee. Spiega che queste linee si chiamano longitudine e scrivi questa parola sulla lavagna.\n\n###Passo 4:\nChiedi agli studenti di immaginare di viaggiare su un aereo verso Est. L'aereo viaggerebbe su un cerchio. Chiedi agli studenti quanti gradi ci sono in un cerchio. La risposta \u00e8 360\u00b0.\n\n###Passo 5:\nChiedi agli studenti se c\u2019\u00e8 un punto ovvio da cui iniziare a contare le linee di longitudine. No, non c\u2019\u00e8 poich\u00e9 la Terra \u00e8 una sfera. Spiega che nel 1884 \u00e8 stato deciso che la linea che attraversa Londra sarebbe stato il Primo Meridiano con una longitudine di 0\u00b0. Muovendosi verso Est l\u2019angolo sarebbe aumentato fino a 90\u00b0 E e poi 180\u00b0. Muovendosi verso Ovest, l\u2019angolo sarebbe aumentato fino a 90\u00b0W e poi fino a 180\u00b0.\n\n###Passo 6:\nGli studenti usano una sfera o un mappamondo per trovare la longitudine della loro posizione. Si annotano il risultato. Gli studenti possono ora dare le coordinate complete, longitudine e latitudine della loro posizione.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/7.jpg)\n\n###Passo 7:\nChiedi agli studenti se conoscono un modo per trovare la loro posizione in un modo pi\u00f9 preciso rispetto a usare un mappamondo. Possiamo usare la tecnologia? Come si viaggia in macchina?\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/astroedu1609-world-map.jpg)\n\n###Passo 8:\nSpiega che oggi siamo in grado di dare coordinate molto pi\u00f9 precise per una posizione usando il *Global Positioning System* (GPS). Esso \u00e8 un *network* di satelliti che orbitano attorno alla Terra nello spazio. Se un ricevitore GPS pu\u00f2 vedere, i.e comunicare, con quattro o pi\u00f9 satelliti, la posizione pu\u00f2 essere trovata usando la tecnica della triangolazione.\n\n###Attivit\u00e0 3: Direzione del Sole\nCapo Verde \u00e8 appena fuori dalla costa ovest dell\u2019Africa del Nord con una latitudine di 15\u00b0 N ed \u00e8 posizionata tra l\u2019equatore (0\u00b0) e il Tropico del Cancro (23.5\u00b0 N). Usando questa conoscenza, vogliamo capire come mai gli abitanti di Capo Verde ogni tanto vedono il sole di mezzogiorno a nord e altre volte a sud. \n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/astroedu1609-latitudes.png)\n\n###Passo 1:\nAssicurati che tutti gli studenti riescano a guardare il mappamondo. Chiedi agli studenti di trovare la loro posizione, l\u2019Equatore e l\u2019asse nord-sud. Puoi avvolgere un pezzo di stringa attorno alla sfera per mostrare la posizione dell\u2019equatore.\n\n###Passo 2:\nIllumina il mappamondo con una lampada e inclina l\u2019asse leggermente verso la luce cos\u00ec che l\u2019area attorno al Polo Nord, indicata dal Circolo Polare Artico, sia illuminata. Posiziona una matita contro il mappamondo e muovila verticalmente tra Nord e Sud. Mostra che se muovi la matita verso nord la sua ombra punter\u00e0 a nord e il Sole sar\u00e0 verso sud. Se muovi la matita verso sud, la sua ombra punter\u00e0 a sud perch\u00e9 il sole di mezzogiorno \u00e8 verso nord.\n\n###Passo 3:\nChiedi agli studenti cosa vedono. Muovendosi verso nord, chiedi in quale direzione punta l\u2019ombra se la matita \u00e8 al di sopra del Sole (verso sud). Muovendosi verso sud, chiedi in quale direzione punta l\u2019ombra se la matita \u00e8 sotto il Sole (verso nord). Dovrebbero anche essere in grado di vedere che c\u2019\u00e8 un punto dove la matita non proietta alcuna ombra.\n\n###Passo 4:\nD\u00ec agli studenti che esiste un cerchio, come l\u2019equatore ma che non attraversa il centro della Terra, chiamato Tropico del Cancro e che si trova a 23.5\u00b0 nord dell\u2019equatore. Possono usare quanto hanno imparato precedentemente per trovare questa linea? Posizionare la matita a questa latitudine.\n\n###Passo 5:\nInclina l\u2019asse in modo tale che non ci sia ombra quando la penna \u00e8 sul Tropico del Cancro. L\u2019asse del mappamondo \u00e8 ora inclinato a 23.5\u00b0 rispetto alla verticale. Per chiunque sulla superficie della Terra in quel punto e chi riesca a vedere il Sole nella posizione della lampada, \u00e8 mezzogiorno del 21 Giugno.\n\n###Passo 6:\nD\u00ec agli studenti che la latitudine di Capo Verde \u00e8 15\u00b0 N. Possono trovare dov\u2019\u00e8 sul mappamondo? E\u2019 a nord o a sud del Tropico del Cancro? Potresti posizionare uno *sticker* per indicarne la posizione.\n\n###Passo 7:\nMantenendo sempre la stessa inclinazione (in modo che il Sole sia direttamente sopra il Tropico del Cancro), muovi la matita verso Capo Verde. Chiedi agli studenti in quale direzione punta l\u2019ombra (dovrebbe essere verso sud).\n\n###Passo 8:\nOra muovi la Terra in modo che sia verso il lato opposto del Sole per rappresentare la situazione sei mesi dopo. L\u2019asse nord dovrebbe ora puntare dall\u2019altra parte rispetto al Sole con lo stesso angolo con il quale il Polo Sud \u00e8 illuminato. Assicurati che Capo Verde punti verso il Sole. Chiedi agli studenti sopra quale parte della Terra \u00e8 diretto il Sole e dimostralo come prima con l\u2019ombra della matita (il Sole \u00e8 diretto sopra il Tropico del Capricorno che \u00e8 a 23.5\u00b0 S).\n\n###Passo 9:\nPosiziona la matita sopra Capo Verde e chiedi agli studenti cosa notano a proposito della direzione dell\u2019ombra (ora sta puntando verso Nord).\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/0107e396-5ae8-4492-80b1-8198c58b5043/astroedu1609-pencil.jpg)\n\n###Passo 10:\nQuindi le persone di Capo Verde qualche volta hanno l\u2019ombra del sole di mezzogiorno verso Nord o verso Sud in base al periodo dell\u2019anno perch\u00e9 la direzione del sole di mezzogiorno cambia durante l\u2019anno. Infatti, tutte le persone che vedono il sole di mezzogiorno verso nord o sud in base al periodo dell\u2019anno vivono tra il Tropico del Cancro e il Tropico del Capricorno.\n\n###Passo 11: \nCome l\u2019asse nord-sud della Terra \u00e8 inclinato relativamente al piano dell\u2019orbita terrestre, il sole di mezzogiorno nel primo giorno d\u2019estate al di sotto del Tropico del Cancro sar\u00e0 verso nord.

Monitoring sea levels used to be a quite difficult task. Even until a few decades ago, this could only be done via direct measurements and probes on open seas. However, with the advent of Earth-observing satellites and radar altimetry missions, it became possible to monitor sea levels very efficiently and effectively. While in-situ measurements only provide a very local perspective of a given probe, and the resolution of the global network is rather low, satellite measurements allow observing the entire Earth with high redundancy and frequency as well as at a high spatial resolution. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/2013_sea-surface_topography.jpg)\n**Figure 1:** Average sea-surface topography for 2013 as mapped by CryoSat combined with data from other missions.

The perturbations seen in the Northern Atlantic are caused by the warm Gulf Stream current (ESA/CNES/CLS, http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2014/06/2013_sea-surface_topography).\n\n<br/>\nKnown satellites with altimetry capabilities include CryoSat and Jason 2/3. The most recent addition is Sentinel 3, a flagship of the European Copernicus Earth observing programme that offers unprecedented spatial resolution.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/DiffAvgSeaLevel_2014_610.png)\n**Figure 2:**Sea level in 2014 compared to the global average at the mid-point of the 1993-2013 time series (NOAA Climate.gov map, adapted from Figure 3.25a in State of the Climate in 2014 report, https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2014-state-climate-sea-level).\n\n<br/>\n**Oceans are on the rise**<br/>\nBy combining such data obtained at different acquisition times, a general trend of the sea level evolution can be derived. When analysing all the data at hand, it is obvious that sea levels have been rising during the last one-and-a-half centuries (Figure 3).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/sea-level-download1-2015.png)\n**Figure 3:** This graph shows cumulative changes in the sea level of the world\u2019s oceans since 1880, based on a combination of long-term tide gauge measurements and recent satellite measurements. This figure shows the average absolute sea level change in inches (1 inch = 25.4 mm), which refers to the height of the ocean surface, regardless of whether the land nearby is rising or falling. Satellite data are based solely on the measured sea level, while the long-term tide gauge data include a small correction factor because the size and shape of the oceans are changing slowly over time. (On average, the ocean floor has been gradually sinking since the last Ice Age peak, 20,000 years ago.) The shaded band shows the likely range of values, based on the number of measurements collected and the precision of the methods used (the United States Environmental Protection Agency, https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/oceans/sea-level.html).\n\n<br/>\nIn summary, the current scientific results show that from 1993 until 2014, the ocean levels have been rising at a rate of up to 2.9 +/- 0.4 mm per year. That is 6 cm within 20 years. And the rate seems to be increasing. The major contributor to the rising oceans is the land ice that melts because of global warming. This already has had a measurable impact on the coastal regions worldwide. A higher sea level appears to increase the numbers of floods, as depicted in Figure 4.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/coastal-flooding-download1-2016.png)\n**Figure 4:** This map shows the average number of days per year in which coastal waters rose above the local threshold for minor flooding at 27 sites along U.S. coasts.

According to the Principle of Archimedes, the floating ice masses in the Arctic displace water equal to their own weight, so the melting of floating ice does not influence the sea levels. On the other hand, melting land ice such as on Greenland or in the Antarctic contributes to the rise in the ocean levels. Radar altimetry satellites like CryoSat-2 help to monitor the thickness of ice sheets, both on land and floating at sea (Figure 5).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/sea_ice_thickness_976_v5.jpg)\n**Figure 5:** A colour-coded altitude map of the Arctic ice cover based on measurements from the CryoSat-2 satellite (BBC News, 21 June 2011; CPOM/UCL/ESA).\n\n<br/>\n**The buoyancy principle of Archimedes**<br/>\nArchimedes, possibly the greatest ancient mathematician and scientist from Syracuse, discovered the buoyancy principle, which is named after him. In simple words, it states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/Archimedes.jpg)\n**Figure 6:** A sketch that illustrates the key parameters of a floating body and the equilibrium between its weight and the buoyant force, which is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid.\n\n<br/> \nIf, for instance, one wants to calculate the ratio of the depth of an ice sheet that is immersed in sea water, the following ansatz can be made.\n\nF<sub>g</sub> = F<sub>a</sub>\n\nWith:\n\nF<sub>g</sub> = m<sub>ice</sub> \u2219 g <br/>\nF<sub>a</sub> = m<sub>w</sub> \u2219 g\n\nHere, m<sub>ice</sub> and m<sub>w</sub> represent the mass of the ice sheet and the mass of the displaced water, respectively. The ice sheet may have a thickness of d, a surface area of A, and it may be immersed by the depth h. From this, one can derive the volumes of the ice sheet V<sub>ice</sub> = A . d and of the displaced water V<sub>w</sub> = A \u2219 h. This leads to:\n\nm<sub>ice</sub> = m<sub>w</sub> \u21d4 \u03c1<sub>ice</sub>V<sub>ice</sub> = \u03c1<sub>w</sub>V<sub>w</sub> \u21d4 \u03c1<sub>ice</sub> \u2219A \u2219 d = \u03c1<sub>w</sub> \u2219 A \u2219 h \u21d4 \u03c1<sub>ice</sub>d = \u03c1<sub>w</sub>h\n\n\u21d2 h/d = \u03c1<sub>ice</sub> / \u03c1<sub>w</sub>  \n\nEven frozen sea ice is practically fresh water and is almost salt free. Therefore, the density of normal water ice applies. Liquid sea water contains on average 3.5% salt, which increases its density to ![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/Equation 1.png)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/8ea11df5-1db9-40cb-9f8c-221385614496/Equation 2.png)\n\nThis means that 90% of the ice sheet is below sea water.\n", "fulldesc": "###**INTRODUCTION**\nThe rise in the sea levels because of global warming is a concern for all of us, and everybody must take responsibility for future generations. The following experiment illustrates one major contributor to the rising sea levels: the melting of ice.\n\nSet up the activity with the following questions:<br/>\n**Question 1:** How do you melt ice?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Ice melts when it is heated or salted.\nRemark: Tell the students that sea water freezes at lower temperatures than fresh water.\n\n**Question 2:** Where on Earth can you find ice?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** glaciers, polar regions, high mountain ranges, lakes during winter.\n\n**Question 3:** Imagine that all that ice melts. What would happen to the water levels?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Water levels rise, because the ice is transformed into water.\n\n**Question 4:** What would happen to the coastal areas on Earth when the sea levels rise?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** They will be flooded.\n\n**Question 5:** When you look at maps, what is the main difference between the northern and southern polar regions? Which of them is the Arctic, and which is Antarctica?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** The Arctic Sea (North Pole) is covered by floating ice. There are no land masses there. Antarctica (South Pole) is a continent with a thick ice layer on top.\n\nStart a discussion to gather opinions on how the melting of either ice shield can affect the water levels.

A plastic cup filled with water is used as a platform that carries the ice (own work).\n\n<br/>\n**Question 6:** In our model, there is a stone with its top above the water surface and covered with ice. What would be the corresponding situation on Earth?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** The model represents the ice masses located on land, as they can be found in the mountains on Greenland or on Antarctica (South Pole).\n\n<br/>\n**EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE PART 1**\n1.\tIce is placed on the platform, and the lamp is switched on.\n2.\tWait until the ice has melted.\n\n**Task 1:** Write down your observations during the first part of the experiment. Pay attention to the water level.\n**Expected outcome:** The ice melts slowly and runs into the bowl.\n\n**Question 7:** What happened to the water level?

Pay attention to the water level.<br/>\n**Expected outcome:** The ice melts and seems to disappear.\n\n**Question 9:** What happened to the water level? Explain the observation.<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** The water level did not change. There is just as much weight/mass of water inside the reservoir as there was before, when the water was in the state of ice. Therefore, nothing has been added.\n\n**Question 10:** When reconsidering the experiment, which of the two forms of ice contributes to the rising sea levels? Land ice or/and floating ice?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Only land ice contributes to the rising sea levels. Floating ice does not contribute because the part of the ice immersed in the water displaces just as much water as would be added if the complete chunk of ice melts.\n\n**Question 11:** What is the impact on the oceans when land ice melts, and the resulting water runs into the sea?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** The sea level rises.\n\n**Question 12:** How would you be able to witness such a rise?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Coastal regions reduce due to flooding.

Il Sole ha una magnitudine apparente di -27, la Luna piena di -13 e il pianeta Venere misura -5 nel momento di massima luminosit\u00e0. Gli oggetti artificiali pi\u00f9 brillanti, gli *iridium flare*, arrivano fino a magnitudine -9, mentre la stazione spaziale a -6.", "fulldesc": "####Preparazione:\nPrima di costruire il lettore di magnitudine in classe, sovrapporre la trasparenza allo stampato del modello. Si noti che lo stampato contiene rettangoli, numerati da 1 a 5, ripetuti tre volte. Tagliare lo stampato e le trasparenze in terzi, in modo da conservare I cinque rettangoli insieme. Produrre tanti modelli quanti sono gli studenti.\n\nScegliere la costellazione da osservare come parte dell'attivit\u00e0 e trovarne un'immagine o una fotografia (Orione in questa attivit\u00e0 - vedi allegato 2). Stampare una copia dell'immagine per ogni studente. (Durante i mesi invernali nell'emisfero settentrionale e nei mesi estivi nell'emisfero meridionale la costellazione di Orione \u00e8 facilmente riconoscibile nella prima serata).\n\nPrima che gli studenti stimino la magnitudine delle stelle, potreste organizzare una \"*festa delle stelle*\" per insegnare agli studenti come trovare e riconoscere la costellazione e come usare il loro lettore di magnitudine per stimare le magnitudini stellari nella costellazione scelta.\n\n####Costruire il Lettore di Magnitudine\n\n###Passo 1\nFar tagliare agli studenti i 5 rettangoli (allegato 1) numerati da 1 a 5, tenendo la trasparenza sovrapposta a ogni modello. Da questo punto in poi, gli studenti faranno le seguenti operazioni.\n\n###Passo 2\nUsare una moneta per tracciare 5 cerchi sui cartoncini e quindi ritagliarli. Alternativamente piegare leggermente a met\u00e0 il cartoncino e praticare dei tagli a forma di V per rimuovere un rombo centrale. Fare attenzione che i fori nel cartoncino siano spaziati in fila nella parte pi\u00f9 larga del cartoncino.\n\n###Passo 3\nNumerare i fori da #1 a 5 da sinistra a destra lungo il cartoncino come mostrato nella figura qui sotto. Incollare il pezzo di trasparenza #1 sopra il foro #1, facendo attenzione che la trasparenza copra completamente il foro. In tutti questi passi, il nastro adesivo non deve coprire i fori. Non importa quale lato della trasparenza sta sopra o sotto.\n\n###Passo 4\nIncollare il pezzo di trasparenza #2 sui fori #1 \u2013 2 , facendo attenzione che copra bene entrambi i fori.\n\n###Passo 5\nIncollare il pezzo di trasparenza #3 sui fori #1 \u2013 3 , facendo attenzione che copra bene tutti i fori.\n\n###Passo 6\nIncollare il pezzo di trasparenza #4 sui fori #1 \u2013 4 , facendo attenzione che copra bene tutti i fori.\n\n###Passo 7\nIncollare il pezzo di trasparenza #5 su tutto il cartoncino.\n\n###Passo 8\nIl primo foro dovrebbe essere coperto da 5 strati di trasparenza, mentre il 5.o dovrebbe essere coperto da uno solo.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/9c01333e-56f0-4520-b61d-aa80099f0c1c/1402_attachment_holes.jpg)\n\n####Stimare la magnitudine delle stelle\nDurante i mesi invernali nell'emisfero Boreale e nei mesi estivi nell'emisfero Australe, la costellazione di Orione \u00e8 visibile nella prima met\u00e0 della serata. Si pu\u00f2 usare il disegno di Orione (allegato  2) o quello di un'altra costellazione che sia visibile in cielo se si osserva in un altro momento dell'anno. Fate uscire nel cortile di casa gli studenti in una notte serena e senza Luna per alcuni minuti con il disegno della costellazione e una matita e chiedete loro di trovare la costellazione nel cielo notturno. Le luci esterne dovrebbero essere spente. Gli studenti devono attendere almeno 5 minuti all'esterno per lasciare che gli occhi si adattino al buio.\n\nGli studenti osservano ogni stella della costellazione attraverso il lettore di magnitudine. Per ogni stella nel disegno della costellazione, gli studenti scrivono il numero pi\u00f9 piccolo del foro attraverso cui possono vedere la stella. Questa \u00e8 una stima della magnitudine o luminosit\u00e0 della stella. Per esempio, una stella di magnitudine 3 verr\u00e0 vista attraverso i fori 3, 4 e 5. Gli studenti segneranno solo il foro #3.\n\nSi noti che gli studenti non saranno in grado di vedere alcune stelle del disegno, a causa dell'inquinamento luminoso. Quando hanno registrato la magnitudine di tutte le stelle mostrate nel disegno di Orione, la magnitudine pi\u00f9 alta (il numero pi\u00f9 alto che viene indicato) sar\u00e0 la magnitudine limite (la stella pi\u00f9 debole) visibile in Orione. Gli studenti dovrebbero segnare anche le condizioni di illuminazione in cui stanno registrando i dati. Fate portare i risultati in classe. In classe confrontate insieme tutti i risultati. Ricordate che pi\u00f9 piccole sono le magnitudini e pi\u00f9 brillanti le stelle; pi\u00f9 alte le magnitudini e pi\u00f9 deboli le stelle. Gli studenti possono stimare quante stelle hanno perso (cio\u00e8, che non sono in grado di vedere) in tutto il cielo a causa dell'inquinamento luminoso nella loro zona.\n\n####Estensione: stima del numero di stelle perse\n(Basato su *Calculating Stars Lost* di Fred Schaaf in *Seeing the Sky*, John Wiley & Sons, 1990) Per completare l'attivit\u00e0 bisogna determinare la magnitudine limite del luogo usando i risultati dell'attivit\u00e0 di stima della magnitudine appena descritta.\n\nOra sapete il numero di stelle visibili che sono influenzate dalla qualit\u00e0 del cielo notturno. La Luna, le condizioni atmosferiche, l'inquinamento luminoso possono rendere difficile o impossibile vedere le stelle pi\u00f9 deboli. Avrete probabilmente scoperto anche che gli astronomi usano la scala delle magnitudini per misurare la luminosit\u00e0 delle stelle. Ricordate che le stelle di magnitudine 1 (prima magnitudine) sono pi\u00f9 brillanti delle stelle di magnitudine 2 (seconda magnitudine), e cos\u00ec via.\n\nPer mezzo dell'attivit\u00e0 *Stima la magnitudine delle stelle* avete imparato a misurare la magnitudine limite del cielo notturno, cio\u00e8 quali sono le stelle pi\u00f9 deboli che si possono vedere. In condizioni perfette \u2013 niente Luna, cielo sereno, nessuna interferenza da luci artificiali \u2013 l'occhio umano pu\u00f2 vedere le stelle fino alla sesta o settima magnitudine. Secondo la tabella qui sotto una magnitudine limite di 7 corrisponde a circa 14000 stelle!\n\nMagnitudine limite | Numero approssimativo di stelle visibili\n--- | ---\n1 | 6\n2 | 45\n3 | 150\n4 | 540\n5 | 1700\n6 | 4900\n7 | 14000\n\nOra siete in grado di calcolare quante stelle avete perso nella vostra postazione osservativa. Non dovete fare altro che sottrarre a 14000 il numero (approssimato) di stelle visibili dalla vostra posizione. Per esempio, se la magnitudine limite che avete misurato \u00e8 3, potete vedere circa 150 stelle a occhio nudo, ma ne state perdendo circa 13850 (14000 \u2013 150 = 13850)!", "curriculum": "Paese | Livello | Materia | Certificazione | Argomento\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nI | Scuola secondaria di primo grado | Fisica | - | Spazio: Altre stelle nella nostra galassia\nI | Scuola primaria: ultimo anno | Scienze | - | Terra e spazio", "additional_information": "- What is Light Pollution: http://www.globeatnight.org/learn_light.html \n- Light Pollution Interactive Game: http://www.globeatnight.org/learn_orionsky.html \n- Stellar Magnitude System: http://www.skyandtelescope.com/howto/basics/Stellar_Magnitude_System.html\n- The astronomical magnitude scale: http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/MagScale.html", "conclusion": "I risultati dell'attivit\u00e0 dovrebbero essere discussi insieme con le domande della Sezione di Valutazione.

Therefore, if scientists want to find planets or other celestial bodies where life may be present, they first want to know if water exists in liquid form there. This, for instance, is also one of the major goals of explorations and investigations of places in the Solar System other than Earth, e.g. Mars.\n\nThe presence of liquid water depends on environmental conditions like air temperature and atmospheric pressure. The main driver of the surface temperatures of planets is their distance from the central star they orbit. The temperatures are just right only in a small window so that water does not completely evaporate or freeze. These conditions are modified by local influences like the density of the atmosphere and the composition of potential greenhouse gases. This defines a range around a given star in which liquid water could be present. This range is defined as the \u2018habitable zone\u2019. If a planet is found orbiting in this zone, it may potentially possess water in the liquid form and thus sustain life as we know it. In the Solar System, Earth occupies the habitable zone. Some models also place Mars in this zone. \n\nThere is no guarantee that any planet orbiting within the habitable zone actually possesses notable amounts of liquid water or harbours life, because the conditions on any given planet can be very different. Other boundary conditions that may help to sustain life are energy sources (light, chemical) and magnetic fields to protect from ionising particle radiation.\n\n<br/>\n**Did or does Mars support life?**<br/>\nMars is half the size of the Earth. Its reddish colour is caused by iron oxide (rust), and it has a very thin atmosphere, which mainly consists of carbon dioxide. One of its special features is its many extinct volcanoes, which reach heights of up to 22,000 metres! Like Earth, it also has seasons as its rotation axis is inclined. Theoretically, if the habitable zone of the Solar System is considered, Mars has the potential to be conducive to life.\n\nTo date, there is no indication that Mars is or was inhabited. However, there is strong evidence that this planet has harboured liquid water on its surface for a long time. The most common explanation for its current state is that Mars has lost its atmosphere because of which most of the water has either evaporated into space or is still present as ice deposits below the surface. Mars is so small that its gravitational force is rather low; therefore, it can barely hold its atmosphere. In addition, the lack of a magnetic field made it easy for solar wind to deplete the early Martian atmosphere. However, there is some evidence that at least for some time and in a few exceptional regions, there may have been liquid water on its surface. A high salinity helps keep water liquid even at temperatures below the freezing point of pure water (see Article 1 attached to this activity).\n\nScientists hope that some form of life could have survived within the ice sheets below the Martian surface. The European Mars programme ExoMars, to be launched in 2020, will investigate this very hypothesis using a robotic laboratory. It will be able to drill below the Martian surface and probe it for chemical and biological activity.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/ExoMars_Rover_annotated_front_20170418.jpg)\n**Figure 1:** Computer model of the ExoMars rover to be launched in 2020 (ESA/ATG medialab, http://exploration.esa.int/\nmars/58885-exomars-rover-front-view-annotated/, http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/ESA_Multimedia/Copyright_\nNotice_Images).\n\n<br/>\n**Other locations in the Solar System**<br/>\nDuring recent years, scientists have entertained the idea that there are other places in the Solar System that might be habitable although they are not within the Sun\u2019s habitable zone. In particular, icy moons such as Europa and Enceladus of the gas planets Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, are interesting from this aspect. Observations made during Solar System exploration missions like NASA\u2019s Cassini have found evidence of subsurface oceans of liquid water below their thick ice shields (see Article 2 attached to this activity). There is strong evidence that there are hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor of Enceladus (see Article 3 attached to this activity). Similar findings have been made in the terrestrial deep sea on Earth. These vents are colonised with life that feeds on hydrogen released from below. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/main_pia11688.jpg)\n**Figure 2:** A dramatic plume sprays water ice and vapour from the south polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Cassini\u2019s first hint of this plume came during the spacecraft\u2019s first close flyby of the icy moon on 17 February 2005 (NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute, https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11688).\n\n<br/>\n**A simple formula for the habitable zone**<br/>\nWith the Earth as the template of a habitable planet, one can calculate the distance from any given star where the conditions would be comparable. This distance is proportional to the luminosity of the star.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Picture1.png)\n\nHere, L<sub>*</sub> is the luminosity of the star and L<sub>\u2299</sub> is the solar luminosity. The distance d<sub>HZ</sub>  may then represent the location of the habitable zone. Its width depends on what temperatures to expect at the inner and outer edges. There are complex models to predict habitability that even include planetary properties like atmospheric conditions and mass. Therefore, the habitable zone is not really a well-defined range within a planetary system but depends on many properties that allow water to be present in its liquid form.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Solarsystemau_habit.jpg)\n**Figure 3:** Distances of habitable zones for stars of varying luminosity (Derpedde, https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nDatei:Solarsystemau_habit.jpg, \u2018Solarsystemau habit\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\n**Exoplanets**<br/>\nPlanets that orbit stars other than the Sun are called \u2018extrasolar planets\u2019 or briefly, \u2018exoplanets\u2019. The first exoplanet hosted by a Sun-like star was discovered in 1995 by a Swiss team led by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz from the University of Geneva. This planet, named 51 Pegasi b, is anything but an Earth-like planet as it revolves around its host star at a distance of only 0.05 AU, i.e. 5% of the mean distance between the Sun and the Earth. Note that even the planet closest to the Sun, Mercury, orbits it at a mean distance of 0.5 AU, i.e. 10 times farther away than 51 Pegasi b is from its host star. In addition, it is a gas giant similar to Jupiter and Saturn. To date (July 2017), we know of 3627 exoplanets, of which 2718 are planetary systems (see http://www.exoplanets.eu).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/HabitableZone.jpg)\n**Figure 4:** The circumstellar habitable zones of three stars that differ in size, luminosity and surface temperature (NASA/Kepler Mission/D.

The star in the middle corresponds to stars similar to the Sun. Hotter stars usually have a large and wide habitable zone, while cooler stars can only provide small and narrow habitable zones. In the blue area, it is too cold for liquid water, and in the red area, it is too hot.\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of an exoplanet around the star HD 33793, also known as Kapteyn\u2019s star. The star has a surface temperature of about 3570 K. This is about half of the surface temperature of the Sun, which is 5778 K. Thus, the habitable zone (indicated in green) is located at a distance between 0.11 and 0.22 AU.\n\nBecause of the lower luminosity of this star, the habitable zone is smaller and narrower. When comparing the habitable zones of the Sun and HD 33793 (Figure 6), we find that they considerably differ. The former is both wider and farther away from the Sun.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/hec_orbit_Kapteyn_b.png)\n**Figure 5:** Habitable zone (green) around the star HD 33793.

For this, it is important that the radiation it receives from its central star adequate to keep the temperatures of the planet above a value that permits water to be in the liquid state. Because of this characteristic whereby a potentially habitable planet receives heat from a star at the right distance, this planet can be viewed as an engine of life that needs adequate power to start.\n\nIntroduce the topic by asking about the Solar System (planets, composition) and where in this system life evolved. Perhaps, initiate a discussion about the conditions required for planets other than Earth (e.g. Venus, Mars) to sustain life. Try to direct the discussion towards the presence of water.\n\n**Question 1:** Is there life on Mars?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** We haven\u2019t found anything that would indicate that there is.\n\n**Question 2:** Is there liquid water on Mars?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Very little to none. At least not as much that we can expect areas of open water or running rivers.\n\n**Question 3:** Why are these two things related?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Water is the key to life. Without water, there is no life the way we know it.\n\nAsk the students if they have heard about planets around stars other than the Sun.\n\n**Question 4:** What does it take to support life on other planets?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** There are a few conditions that help in the formation and maintenance of life, but the key is \u2013 again \u2013 water. Heat is only needed to keep the water liquid, at least in some places. Other conditions that may help are energy sources (light, chemical) or magnetic fields to protect from ionising particle radiation. But since life evolves in oceans, this does not really matter.\n\n**Question 5:** What conditions are needed to keep water liquid?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Heat and perhaps salt. Salt helps to lower temperatures to keep water liquid.\n\n**Question 6:** What provides the Earth and other planets with the heat needed to keep water liquid?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** Stars, the Sun. The greenhouse effect generated by an atmosphere helps to raise temperatures.\n\n**Question 7:** What happens to water if it is very cold or very hot?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** It freezes or boils and evaporates.\n\nThe following experiment is a simple analogy in which the star is represented by a lamp and the planet is represented by a photovoltaic cell combined with a motor.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 1: ENGINE OF LIFE**\nMaterials needed:\n- Strong lamp, floodlight\n- Dimmer switch to regulate the brightness\n- Folding rule or yardstick\n- Photovoltaic cell with attached electric motor or fan (ensure that the power the cell generates is adequate to drive the motor)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/SolarCell_ConnectionFan.jpg)\n**Figure 7:** Illustration showing the soldered connection between a solar cell and a computer fan. Here, the connection can be interrupted with microplugs. The polarity is indicated next to the soldering points of the photovoltaic cell (M. Nielbock).\n\n<br/>\n**Experimental set-up**\n1.\tSolder the motor to the photovoltaic cell. This is usually very simple. The cells provide soldering points with their polarities indicated. Just use cables (often already attached to the motor) and connect them to the corresponding electrical poles (see Figure 7).\n2.\tA coloured cardboard disc attached to the rotation axis improves the visualisation of the motor\u2019s speed as it runs. If a fan is used, the wings may be painted.\n3.\tPlug the lamp into the dimmer and the dimmer into the socket.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/ExperimentalSetup.png)\n**Figure 8:** Experimental set-up (M. T\u00fcrk).\n\n<br/>\n**Question 8:** How will the motor behave if the cell is held at different distances from the lamp?<br/>\n**Expected outcomes from discussion:** The rotation speed depends on the distance. Far = slow, near = fast.\n\n**Experimental procedure**\n1.\tSwitch on the lamp.\n2.\tHold the photovoltaic cell far away from the lamp. The motor should not move.\n3.\tMoving closer to the lamp, determine the distance at which the motor starts moving.\n4.\tRepeat this procedure for different brightness settings of the lamp by using the dimmer.\n\n**Tasks:**<br/> 1. Write down your observations. Describe the results you get when varying the brightness of the lamp.<br/> **Expected result:** The distance necessary for the electric motor to begin moving is smaller with a dimmed lamp than with a bright lamp.<br/> 2. To compare this model experiment with the configuration of the Solar System, life-sustaining conditions (those under which the motor moves) are possible because the Earth (photovoltaic cell) is close enough to the Sun (lamp). The point at which the motor starts running is the outer edge of the habitable zone. What does this experiment tell us about exoplanets in other planetary systems with different stars that are supposed to harbour life?<br/> **Expected result:** A planet in a planetary system with a star that is less bright than the Sun needs to be located closer to its host star in order to be in the habitable zone.<br/> \n\nFor ages 14 and higher:<br/> 3. What happens to the motor when the cell is very close to the lamp?<br/>**Expected result:** It runs very fast. It \u2018overheats\u2019.<br/> 4. Can we expect planets sustaining life to be at any distance inside the inner edge of the habitable zone?<br/>\n**Expected result:** No, because as the distance decreases, the radiation the planet receives is higher. This leads to increased heating of the planet. If the temperature is too high, water cannot remain liquid.\n\nThis activity provides a qualitative impression of the nature and basic principle of the habitable zone. But what does a habitable zone actually look like? The next activity gives an example that is close to scientific research. It shows how one can identify the habitable zone and the planets within it.\n\n###**ACTIVITY 2: THE HABITABLE ZONE OF KEPLER-62**\nMaterials needed:\n- Pencils (regular and coloured)\n- Compass (drawing tool)\n- Millimetre paper\n- Ruler\n- Calculator\n- Computer with internet access (can be only one operated by the teacher)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/742541main_Kepler-62MorningStar-1_full.jpg)\n**Figure 9:** Artistic impression of the Kepler-62f exoplanet (NASA Ames/JPL-Caltech).\n\n<br/>\nKepler-62 is a star that is a little cooler and smaller than the Sun.

The main properties of the five planets are given in Table 2. All planetary orbits are nearly circular and listed in astronomical units (AU). This is the mean distance between the Sun and Earth.\n\n**Table 2: Properties of the five exoplanets of the Kepler-62 system.**<br/>\n\nName | Orbital radius (AU) | Mass (Earth masses)\n--- | --- \nKepler-62b | 0.0553 | ca. 2.1\nKepler-62c | 0.093 | ca. 0.1 \nKepler-62d | 0.120 | ca. 5.5\nKepler-62e | 0.427 | ca. 4.5 \nKepler-62f | 0.712 | ca. 2.8\n\n<br/>\n**Tasks (Drawing a scaled model)**<br/>\nDetermine or discuss a suitable scale that allows you to put the entire system on a sheet of paper.\n\nFill the table (Table 3) with the scaled orbital radii. Round up the values to full millimetres.\n\nThe model will show the planetary system from a bird\u2019s eye view. Use the compass to draw the scaled circular orbits around the assumed position of the host star Kepler-62.\n\nIn the next step, you will add the habitable zone. First, you can apply the simple equation\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Picture1.png)\n\nwhich only depends on the luminosity of the star. Note that this equation tells you where an Earth-like planet would be located around a Sun-like star of lower luminosity. Use Table 1 to calculate the distance of the habitable zone from Kepler-62. Note that the distance of the habitable zone scales with the square root of the stellar luminosity.\n\nQ: Using this simple relation, where with regard to the Solar System would the habitable zone be if a star had four times the luminosity of the Sun?<br/>\nA: It would be at twice the distance as compared to the habitable zone of the Solar System.\n\nCalculating the proper boundaries of habitable zones can be tricky and needs sophisticated models. There is an online tool at\n\nhttp://depts.washington.edu/naivpl/sites/default/files/hz.shtml\n\nthat performs the calculations when the luminosity and surface temperature of the star are provided (This can be done by the teacher instead of providing computer access for all students.). All you have to do is enter the surface temperature Teff and the luminosity of the star in the upper two fields, as shown in Figure 11. Note that after entering a value, you have to click in the field again.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Fig 11.png)\n**Figure 11:** Screen shot of the online tool to calculate the dimensions of a habitable zone. The example above shows the values of the Sun. Important: After inserting the values, you have to click in the field to submit the entry (http://depts.washington.edu/naivpl/sites/default/files/hz.shtml).\n\n<br/>\nUse the values of Kepler-62 from Table 1. Use the result labelled as \u2018Conservative habitable zone limits (1 Earth mass)\u2019 and \u2018HZ distance from the star (AU)\u2019. Add the distances for the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone to the table below and calculate the scaled radii.\n\n**Table 3: Orbital parameters of the Kepler-62 planetary system (The scaled values are optimised for a sheet of A4 paper with a width of 18 cm. They are not provided with the worksheets).**<br/>\n\nName | Orbital radius (AU) | Scaled radius (cm)\n--- | --- \nKepler-62b | 0.0553 | 0.60 \nKepler-62c | 0.093 | 1.01 \nKepler-62d | 0.120 | 1.30\nKepler-62e | 0.427 | 4.64\nKepler-62f | 0.712 | 7.74 \nHabitable Zone (inner) | 0.456 | 4.96\nHabitable Zone (outer) | 0.828 | 9.00\n\n<br/>\nQ: How well does the simple distance of the habitable zone agree with the model calculation?<br/>\nA: The simple value is close to the inner edge of the more accurately calculated habitable zone.\n\nQ: Can you think of a reason why the simple solution is so close to the extreme value of the modelled solution? In which way do the two approaches differ? (Hint: If the students have difficulties with the answer, let them use the online calculator with the solar surface temperature instead of the stellar luminosity.)<br/>\nA: The simple approach does not take into account the surface temperature.\n\nQ (perhaps better suited for higher term classes): How does the missing parameter (surface temperature) influence the radiation characteristics of Kepler-62?<br/>\nA: Lower temperatures mean redder spectra. The spectrum of Kepler-62 contains a relatively higher amount of infrared radiation than that of the Sun. This is more effective in directly heating planetary atmospheres.\n\nNow add the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone to the scaled model of the planetary system. \n\nYou can colour the area between the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone. Green would be appropriate.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Keplersystem.png)\n**Figure 12:** Model of the Kepler-62 system (solution not presented to the students).\n\nQ: Which of the planets are inside the habitable zone?<br/>\nA: Kepler-62f\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "This activity is part of a larger toolbox called the \u2018Climate Box\u2019, which was developed within the space education project \u2018EU Space Awareness\u2019, funded by the European Commission.\n\n", "conclusion": "This activity teaches the students about the habitable zones of planetary systems.

La Via Lattea \u00e8 una galassia a spirale abbastanza grande e ha tre componenti principali: un disco, nel quale risiede il sistema solare, un rigonfiamento centrale nel nucleo e un alone onnicomprensivo.\n\nIl disco della Via Lattea ha quattro bracci a spirale e ha uno spessore di circa 300 parsec (1 parsec \u00e8 di circa 3,26 anni luce) e 30.000 parsec di diametro. Confronta questo con le quattro ore che impiega la luce per viaggiare dal Sole a Nettuno! La nostra galassia \u00e8 composta prevalentemente da stelle della Popolazione I, che tendono ad essere blu e sono ragionevolmente giovani, con un'et\u00e0 compresa tra un milione e dieci miliardi di anni.\n\n**Anno luce**:\n\nL'anno luce \u00e8 l'unit\u00e0 di misura utilizzata dagli astronomi per misurare le distanze astronomiche ed equivale alla distanza percorsa dalla luce in un anno, ovvero circa 9,46 trilioni di chilometri.\n\nIl rigonfiamento centrale della galassia \u00e8 un ellisse schiacciata di 1000x6000 parsec. \u00c8 una regione ad alta densit\u00e0 dove predominano le stelle della Popolazione 2: stelle che tendono a essere rosse e sono molto vecchie, con un'et\u00e0 di circa 10 miliardi di anni. Ci sono crescenti prove della presenza di un buco nero estremamente massiccio al suo centro.\n\n**Buchi neri**:\n\nI buchi neri sono i mostri dello spazio! Qualsiasi cosa si avvicini troppo a un buco nero viene attirata da esso con una forza cos\u00ec potente che non ha alcuna possibilit\u00e0 di fuga. Anche la luce - la cosa pi\u00f9 veloce nell'universo - \u00e8 condannata se si avvicina a uno di questi mostri. Questo \u00e8 il motivo per cui i buchi neri sono neri. Tuttavia, non sono veramente buchi e non sono vuoti. I buchi neri sono in realt\u00e0 pieni di materia che \u00e8 stipata in una regione estremamente piccola.\n\nL'alone, una regione sferica sparsa, circonda il disco. Ha una bassa densit\u00e0 di stelle vecchie principalmente in ammassi globulari (compresi tra 10.000 e 1.000.000 di stelle). Si ritiene che l'alone sia composto per lo pi\u00f9 di materia oscura, che pu\u00f2 estendersi ben oltre il bordo del disco.\n\n**Materia oscura**:\n\nSecondo gli scienziati, circa l'80% della massa dell'universo \u00e8 costituita da materia che non si pu\u00f2 osservare direttamente. Questa materia, nota come materia oscura, non emette luce o energia.\n\n**Classificazione delle galassie**:\n\nEsistono due categorie principali di galassie, la spirale e l'ellittica, e altre due lenticolari e irregolari.\n\nLa nostra galassia appartiene alla categoria spirale. Le galassie a spirale si dividono in diverse classi a seconda della loro forma e della dimensione relativa del rigonfiamento: le spirali ordinarie sono etichettate come Sa, b, c, d, m mentre quelle che hanno sviluppato una barra nella regione interna delle braccia a spirale sono etichettate SBa, b, c, d, m. Le galassie a spirale sono caratterizzate dalla presenza di gas nel disco, il che implica che la formazione stellare \u00e8 attiva al momento attuale, quindi la popolazione di stelle \u00e8 pi\u00f9 giovane. Le spirali si trovano di solito in un campo galattico a bassa densit\u00e0 dove la loro forma delicata pu\u00f2 evitare la deformazione da parte delle forze di marea delle galassie vicine.\n\n**Forze di marea**:\n\nQueste forze sono un effetto secondario delle forze gravitazionali tra due oggetti che si avvicinano l'un l'altro, come la Terra e la Luna. Le forze di marea sono responsabili della fluttuazione delle maree e della rotazione sincrona di certe lune mentre orbitano attorno ai loro pianeti.\n\nLe galassie ellittiche sono collocate nelle categorie E0-7 a seconda del loro grado di ellitticit\u00e0, con E0 che \u00e8 meno ellittico. Hanno una luminosit\u00e0 uniforme e sono simili al rigonfiamento di una galassia a spirale, ma senza disco. Le stelle sono vecchie e non c'\u00e8 gas presente. Le ellittiche si trovano solitamente in un campo ad alta densit\u00e0, al centro dei *cluster*.\n\nLe galassie lenticolari sono etichettate come S0 e, sebbene posseggano sia un rigonfiamento che un disco, non hanno bracci a spirale. C'\u00e8 poco o niente gas e quindi tutte le stelle sono vecchie. Sembrano essere una classe intermedia.\n\nLe irregolari sono piccole galassie, etichettate Irr, senza rigonfiamenti e una forma mal definita.", "fulldesc": "*Suggerimento*. \u00c8 possibile vedere la Via Lattea ad occhio nudo. La si pu\u00f2 osservare meglio a gennaio quando c'\u00e8 la lune nuova. Incoraggia gli studenti a osservarla, se possibile.\n\n###Preparazione\nPer l'attivit\u00e0 *Sempre pi\u00f9 lontano* dovrai cercare il film *Powers of Ten* su Internet. Guardalo e presta attenzione cos\u00ec da capire quando discutere ognuna delle domande. Preparati a mostrare il film alla classe.\n\n###Attivit\u00e0 1: sempre pi\u00f9 lontano\n###Passo 1:\nLeggi l'e-mail nell'Attivit\u00e0 1 del foglio di lavoro con gli studenti. Essi dovranno trovare le risposte alle seguenti domande dei ricercatori:\n\n1. Come appare la Via Lattea?\n2. In che punto della Via Lattea si trova il nostro Sistema Solare?\n3. Perch\u00e9 non possiamo vedere l'intera Via Lattea dalla Terra?\n4. La Terra \u00e8 grande o piccola rispetto all'universo?\n5. La Via Lattea \u00e8 grande o piccola rispetto all'universo?\n6. Di cosa \u00e8 fatta la Via Lattea?\n\n###Passo 2:\nGuarda il film *Powers of Ten* con gli studenti per trovare le risposte alle domande dei ricercatori. Questo film mostra un viaggio da un picnic in un prato erboso in America fino a una posizione oltre la Via Lattea. A met\u00e0 del film il viaggio ritorna al prato e nella mano di uno dei *picnickers*. Si consiglia di riprodurre il film fino a quando il viaggio ritorna al campo da picnic in modo che gli studenti abbiano una buona impressione dell'immensa dimensione dell'universo e di quanto minuscola la Terra sia in confronto.\n\n###Passo 3:\nInizia guardando l'intero film con gli studenti e mano a mano spiega loro cosa stanno vedendo. Riguarda il film, ma questa volta sospendi se necessario, per dare agli studenti l'opportunit\u00e0 di rispondere alle domande. Dopo aver visto il film per la seconda volta, gli studenti saranno in grado di rispondere alle domande da a a e. Una volta completata l'attivit\u00e0 *Crea una Via Lattea*, gli studenti saranno in grado di rispondere alla domanda finale.\n\n###Passo 4:\nGli studenti indagano su come appare la Via Lattea e la sua posizione nell'universo rispetto al nostro Sistema Solare.\n\n###Attivit\u00e0 2: Crea una Via Lattea\nOra gli studenti hanno un'idea di come sia la Via Lattea e potranno farne un modello. Gli studenti completano l'attivit\u00e0 2 sul foglio di lavoro.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/9321b1c0-dae7-4cc0-8e2f-464539461881/astroedu1611-milkyway-model.png)\n\n###Attivit\u00e0 3: Cosa sai della Via Lattea?\nGli studenti leggono le istruzioni nell'attivit\u00e0 3 e scrivono tutte le risposte alle domande nell'e-mail nel compito 1. Se necessario, guarda il film *Powers of Ten* ancora una volta. Discutere le risposte nell'e-mail.\n\n1. Se potessimo vedere la Via Lattea di lato, sembrerebbe un piattino con un rigonfiamento nel mezzo.\n2. Il sistema solare della Terra \u00e8 situato in un braccio a spirale a circa due terzi della distanza dal centro della Via Lattea.\n3. Non abbiamo alcun telescopio che possa arrivare abbastanza lontano alla Via Lattea per scattarne una buona fotografia nella sua interezza. Le immagini esistenti della Via Lattea sembrano fotografie reali, ma sono in realt\u00e0 l'impressione di un artista di ci\u00f2 che pensiamo che vi assomiglia. Spiega che \u00e8 possibile vedere parte del disco della Via Lattea di notte quando il cielo \u00e8 buio. \u00c8 facile fotografare il disco della Via Lattea dalla Terra, perch\u00e9 questa \u00e8 la parte che possiamo vedere.\n4. L'aspetto pi\u00f9 importante di questa domanda \u00e8 che gli studenti vedono che il nostro sistema solare \u00e8 solo una piccola parte della Via Lattea.\n5. Anche qui, la Via Lattea \u00e8 solo una piccola parte di un universo molto pi\u00f9 grande.\n6. La Via Lattea \u00e8 una galassia composta da polvere, gas e almeno 200 miliardi di stelle, la maggior parte delle quali pu\u00f2 essere trovata nel disco. Il sistema contiene vecchie stelle, stelle pi\u00f9 giovani, polvere e nuvole di gas. \u00c8 composto da un rigonfiamento centrale e un disco con quattro grandi e diversi bracci a spirale pi\u00f9 piccoli.\n\n*Buono a sapersi*: occorrono 8 minuti alla luce proveniente dal Sole per raggiungere la Terra. Ci vuole molto pi\u00f9 tempo per la luce dalle altre stelle per raggiungere la Terra. Quindi, quando guardiamo l'universo, stiamo davvero guardando il passato. Si stima che la massa dell'universo sia 100 miliardi di volte pi\u00f9 grande della massa del Sole.\n\n###Attivit\u00e0 4: il nome Via Lattea\nChiedi agli studenti se sanno da dove proviene il nome Via Lattea.\n\nLa mitologia egizia descrive la Via Lattea come formata dal latte di una mucca celeste. I quattro piedi della mucca erano sostenuti dai quattro angoli della Terra. La mitologia greca racconta la storia che a Era, la moglie di Zeus era stato dato il piccolo Eracle da allattare al seno. Quando si rese conto che non era suo figlio, lo spinse via. Il latte versato divenne la Via Lattea.\n\n\u00c8 importante che gli studenti si rendano conto che molto tempo fa la gente non aveva idea di cosa fosse realmente la Via Lattea.", "curriculum": "Paese | Livello | Materia | Certificazione | Argomento \n-|-|-|-|-\nI | Scuola primaria: ultimi anni | Matematica | - | Numeri e sistema posizionale: contare avanti o indietro in gruppo di potenze di 10 fino a 1000000. \nI | Scuola primaria | Arte e disegno | - | Usare disegno, pittusa e scultura per sviluppare e condividere idee, esperienze e immaginazione. \nI | Scuola primaria | Italiano | - | Lettura e comprensione: sviluppare il piacere nella lettura, le motivazioni per leggere, il vocabolario e la comprensione ascoltando e discutendo una serie di poesie, storie e saggi a un livello superiore a quello in cui possono leggere da soli.

The surface of a sphere is a curved area, and using directions like up and down is not useful, because the surface of a sphere has neither a beginning nor an ending. Instead, we can use spherical polar coordinates originating from the centre of the sphere, which has a fixed radius (Figure 1). Two angular coordinates remain, which for the Earth are called the latitude and the longitude. The North Pole is defined as the point where the theoretical axis of rotation coincides with the surface of the sphere, and the Earth rotates in a counter-clockwise direction when the pole is viewed from above. The opposite point is the South Pole. The equator is defined as the great circle halfway between the poles.\n\nThe latitudes are circles parallel to the equator. They are counted from 0\u00b0 at the equator to \u00b190\u00b0 at the poles. The longitudes are great circles connecting the two poles of the Earth. For a given position on Earth, the longitude going through the zenith, which is the point directly above, is called the meridian. This is the line that the Sun apparently crosses at local noon. The origin of this coordinate is defined as the meridian of Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory of England is located. From there, longitudes are counted from 0\u00b0 to +180\u00b0 (eastward) and -180\u00b0 (westward).\n\nExample: Heidelberg in Germany is located at 49.4\u00b0 North and 8.7\u00b0 East.\n\n<br/>\n**Elevation of the poles (pole height)**<br/>\nIf we project the terrestrial coordinate system of latitudes and longitudes in the sky, we get the celestial equatorial coordinate system. The Earth\u2019s equator becomes the celestial equator and the geographical poles are extrapolated to build the celestial poles. If we were to take a photograph of the northern sky with a long exposure, we would see from the trails of the stars that they all revolve about a common point, which is the northern celestial pole (Figure 2).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Live Oak star trails - Flickr.jpg)\n**Figure 2:** Trails of stars at the sky after an exposure time of approximately 2 hours (Credit: Ralph Arvesen, Live Oak star trails, https://www.flickr.com/photos/rarvesen/9494908143, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode)\n\n<br/>\nIn the northern hemisphere, there is a moderately bright star near the celestial pole, which is the North Star or Polaris. If we stood exactly at the geographical North Pole, Polaris would always be directly overhead. We can say that its elevation would be (almost) 90\u00b0. This information introduces the horizontal coordinate system (Figure 3), which is a natural reference we use every day. We, the observers, are the origin of that coordinate system located on a flat plane, whose edge is the horizon. The sky is imagined as a hemisphere above. The angle between an object in the sky and the horizon is the altitude or elevation. The direction within the plane is given as an angle between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, the azimuth, which is usually measured clockwise from the north. In navigation, this is also called the bearing. The meridian is the line that connects north and south at the horizon and passes the zenith.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.png)\n**Figure 3:** Illustration of the horizontal coordinate system. The observer is the origin of the coordinates assigned as the azimuth and altitude or elevation (Credit: TW Carlson, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.svg, \u2018Azimuth-Altitude schematic\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nFor any other position on Earth, the celestial pole or Polaris would appear at an elevation less than 90\u00b0. At the equator, it would just appear at the horizon, that is, at an elevation of 0\u00b0. The correlation between the latitude (North Pole = 90\u00b0, Equator = 0\u00b0) and the elevation of Polaris is no coincidence. Figure 4 combines all three mentioned coordinate systems. For a given observer at any latitude on Earth, the local horizontal coordinate system touches the terrestrial spherical polar coordinate system at a single tangent point. The sketch demonstrates that the elevation of the celestial north pole, also called the pole height, is exactly the northern latitude of the observer on Earth.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/PoleHeightLatitude_high_low.png)\n**Figure 4:** When combining the three coordinate systems (terrestrial spherical, celestial equatorial and local horizontal), it becomes clear that the latitude of the observer is exactly the elevation of the celestial pole, also known as the pole height (Credit: M. Nielbock, own work).\n\n<br/>\n**Early navigation**<br/>\nEarly seafaring peoples often navigated along coastlines before sophisticated navigational skills were developed and tools were invented. Sailing directions helped to identify coastal landmarks (Hertel, 1990). To some extent, their knowledge about winds and currents helped them to cross short distances, e.g. in the Mediterranean.\n\nSoon, navigators realised that celestial objects, especially stars, can be used to maintain the course of a ship. Such skills have been mentioned in early literature like Homer\u2019s Odyssey, which is believed to date back to the 8th century BCE. There are accounts of ancient Phoenicians who were able to even leave the Mediterranean and ventured on voyages to the British coast and even several hundred miles south along the African coast (Johnson & Nurminen, 2009). A very notable and well-documented long-distance voyage has been mentioned by ancient authors and scholars like Strabo, Pliny and Diodorus of Sicily. It is the voyage of Pytheas, a Greek astronomer, geographer and explorer from Marseille who, around 300 BCE, apparently left the Mediterranean by passing Gibraltar and carried on north until the British Isles and beyond the Arctic Circle, where he possibly reached Iceland or the Faroe Islands, which he called Thule (Baker & Baker, 1997). Pytheas used a gnomon or sundial, which allowed him to determine his latitude and measure the time during his voyage (Nansen, 1911).\n \n<br/>\n**Sailing along a latitude**<br/>\nIn ancient times, the technique of sailing along a parallel (of the equator) or latitude was based on observing circumpolar stars. The concept of latitudes in the sense of angular distances from the equator was probably not known. However, it was soon realised that when looking at the night sky, some stars within a certain radius around the celestial poles never set; these are circumpolar stars. When sailing north or south, sailors observe that the celestial pole changes, too, and with it, the circumpolar radius. Therefore, whenever navigators see the same star culminating, i.e. transiting the meridian, at the same elevation, they stay on the \u2018latitude\u2019.  For them, it was sufficient to realise the connection between the elevation of stars and their course. Navigators had navigational documents that listed seaports together with the elevation of known stars. In order to reach the port, they simply sailed north or south until they reached the corresponding latitude and then continued west or east.\n\nNowadays, the easiest way to determine one\u2019s latitude on Earth is to measure the elevation of the North Star, Polaris, as a proxy for the true celestial North Pole. In our era, Polaris is less than a degree off. However, 1000 years ago, it was 8\u00b0 away from the pole.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/VikingRoutesGoogle.png)\n**Figure 5:** Vikings probably used the technique of sailing along the latitude to reach destinations west of Scandinavia (red lines). Iceland is on the 64th northern latitude and 680 nautical miles away from Norway\u2019s coast. The voyage to Greenland along the 61st northern latitude passes the Shetland and Faroe Islands. A stopover in Iceland is a viable alternative.\n\n<br/>\nHowever, using Polaris to determine the north direction and one\u2019s own latitude only works when it is dark enough to see the 2 mag bright star. On a clear day, this is only possible during nautical or astronomical twilight, that is, when the Sun has set and its centre is over 6\u00b0 below the horizon. However, at latitudes higher than 61\u00b0 north, the Sun remains well above such low (negative) elevations, especially around the summer solstice. This is the realm north of the Shetland Islands, that is, near the Faroe Islands and Iceland. Hence, observing Polaris becomes rather difficult in the summer, which is the preferred season for sailing. For latitudes north of the Arctic Circle, where sea ice can block passages during the winter, the Sun never sets for a certain period during the summer. Therefore, other techniques were needed for navigation.\n\n<br/>\n**The Vikings**<br/>\nThe Vikings were Northern Germanic tribes who were known for their seamanship, influential culture and wide trade network. And they were feared for the raids and pillages they executed with roaring brutality. However, contrary to common urban legends, the Vikings were not the filthy, savage barbarians that wore horned helmets when going into battle. Instead, they seemed to be well groomed, and bathed at least once a week (Berg Petersen, 2012). The Vikings originated in the coastal regions around western and southern Scandinavia as well as Denmark. During their explorations, they settled in Iceland, Greenland, Newfoundland, Normandy and the British Isles. However, they ventured as far as Northern America, all around Europe, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea (Figure 6). Without superior navigational skills, such a successful expansion and exploration would not have been possible.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Viking_Expansion.png)\n**Figure 6:** Map of Viking expansion between the 8th and 11th centuries. Their origins are the Norwegian coast and southern Sweden as well as Denmark (Credit: Max Naylor, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Viking_Expansion.svg, public domain).\n\n<br/>\nThe beginning of the Viking Era is commonly dated as 793 CE, with their raid of the Christian monastery of Lindisfarne (Graham-Campbell, 2001) in Northumbria, England. However, the Gallo-Roman historian St. Gregory of Tours reports on an earlier attack by a Danish king named Chlochilaicus on Austrasia, the homeland of the Merovingian Franks, around 520 CE. It is believed that this Danish king may be identical to the mythical character of Hygelac in the Beowulf poem (Susanek, 2000). The Viking Era ended with the Battle of Hastings between the English and the Norman-French, who were descendants of the Vikings, and the destruction and abandonment of Hedeby, an important Viking settlement and trading post, in 1066. As it marked the Norman conquest of Britain, the Battle of Hastings was such an important turning point in British history that it was documented with vivid pictures in the Bayeux Tapestry (Figure 7), which was made in the 1070s but remains in excellent shape even now (Hicks, 2007).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Odo_bayeux_tapestry.png)\n**Figure 7:** A segment of the Bayeux Tapestry depicting Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and half-brother to William the Conqueror, rallying the Norman troops during the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The Bayeux Tapestry is a 70-metre-long embroidered cloth depicting the Battle of Hastings and the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England. It was probably commissioned by Odo himself (Hicks, 2007) (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Odo_bayeux_tapestry.png, public domain).\n\n<br/>\n**Viking navigation**<br/>\nThe Vikings were famous for their longships, which were multi-purpose ships that could be used on rivers, shallow coastal waters and oceans. These ships were used for trade, exploration and warfare. Depending on their size, they could carry from a dozen up to 80 sailors. Because of their shallow draught, many of them did not need a harbour to make landfall and could simply be beached. Viking longships were usually decorated with carved ornaments. Propulsion was provided by sails or oars which could achieve speeds of 15 to 20 knots.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Viking,_replica_of_the_Gokstad_Vi_0tmNWOq.jpg)\n**Figure 8:** The \u2018Viking\u2019, a replica of the Gokstad Viking ship, at the Chicago World Fair 1893 (Di Cola & Stone, 2012). With a crew of 11, it crossed the Atlantic and reached Chicago within 2 months (public domain).\n\n<br/>\nAssuming an average speed of 5 knots, crossing the Northern Sea would have been possible within one or two days. Longer trips, e.g. from Norway to Iceland, would have been achieved within five to seven days.\n\nThe Viking sailors were very experienced in interpreting the signs provided by nature. They were able to read the migratory routes of birds (Forte, Oram, & Pedersen, 2005) and whales as well as interpret the smells and sounds that the wind carried from distant shores. The Vikings probably did not have any sea charts, but they used chants and rhymes that contained sailing information, as mentioned in the medieval Hauksb\u00f3k chronicle (Sawyer, 1997), and were passed on from generation to generation. For instance, the route from southern Norway to Greenland passes the Shetland Islands and Iceland. Sighting of these lands could be used to correct the course, which perfectly coincides with staying on latitude 61\u00b0 north. Therefore, the Vikings must have had the skills to follow this latitude.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/North_season.jpg)\n**Figure 9:** Illumination of the northern and southern hemispheres of the Earth during its orbit around the Sun (Credit: Tau'olunga, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:North_season.jpg, CC 0).\n\n<br/>\nAs mentioned before, the Sun played an important role in identifying a ship\u2019s course. The difficulty with the Sun compared to the stars is that the Sun changes its declination, that is, the elevation above the equator, during the course of a year. The reason for this is that the Earth revolves around the Sun on a tilted axis.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Earth-lighting-summer-solstice_EN.png)\n**Figure 10:** On the summer solstice, the Sun is directly above the Tropic of Cancer. Its apparent position changes during the year (Credit: Przemyslaw \u2018Blueshade\u2019 Idzkiewicz (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Earth-lighting-summer-solstice_EN.png), \u2018Earth-lighting-summer-solstice EN\u2019, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\nIn the summer, the northern hemisphere faces the Sun, while during the winter, the southern hemisphere faces the Sun. The range under which the Sun appears in the zenith is the latitudes between 23.4\u00b0 north, the Tropic of Cancer, and 23.4\u00b0 South, the Tropic of Capricorn. For any given location on Earth, the Sun\u2019s elevation while it transits the meridian \u2013 the line that connects North and South at the horizon through the zenith \u2013 changes by the same angular range, i.e. \u00b123.4\u00b0 around the celestial equator.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/SunAltitude.png)\n**Figure 11:** The diurnal and annual elevation of the Sun above the horizon for a latitude of 61\u00b0 north (Credit: Created using the Sun chart path program of the University of Oregon, USA, http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SunChartProgram.html).\n\n<br/>\nFor a latitude of 61\u00b0 north, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon is shown in Figure 11. South is at the centre at an azimuth of 180\u00b0. Through the year, the elevation of the Sun at local noon changes by almost 47\u00b0. However, the rate of change is not constant. We can assume a variation in the solar declination of up to 1\u00b0 per voyage to be acceptable for navigational purposes.\n\nIf this variation between two consecutive days is accounted for, the Sun could be used to determine the latitude at any time of the year. This would mean that within two days, the declination of the Sun \u2013 or its elevation at noon \u2013 never changes by more than 1\u00b0. This corresponds to a deviation of 8 km after travelling for 240 sea miles. As has already been pointed out, two days are sufficient for voyages through the Northern Sea. For journeys that last five to seven days, the permissible period in which the Sun can be used for navigation in the northern hemisphere is between the end of May and the beginning of July. This time period is adequate to travel from southern Norway to Iceland. The corresponding drift due to the changing solar elevation amounts to 25 km or less. For longer travels, e.g. to Greenland, the course can be adjusted using landmarks on the way, for instance, when passing the Shetland Islands, the Faroe Islands and Iceland. Is there evidence for navigational tools that the Vikings used that were based on the Sun?\n\n<br/>\n**The sun shadow board**<br/>\nSailing along the latitude was probably facilitated by a device called solskuggerfj\u00f8l (\u2018sun shadow board\u2019 Figure 12). Eighteenth century sailors from the Faroe Islands have been seen using a wooden disk of up to 30 cm in diameter with engraved concentric rings and a central gnomon whose height could be adjusted (Tjgaard, 2011). This board was placed inside a bucket of water to cancel out the ship\u2019s movements. It is quite likely that this device was already in use during the Viking age.\n\nIf we assume a negligible change in the Sun\u2019s declination, the shadow of the gnomon at noon can be calibrated to any latitude by aligning its tip with a circle. When read during noon on subsequent days, the tip of the shadow should again touch the same circle. If the shadow is shorter, the position is too far south; if it is longer, it is too far north.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/shadowboard.png)\n**Figure 12:** Sketch of the Viking sun shadow board (Credit: M. Nielbock, own work).\n\n<br/>\n**The sun compass**<br/>\nThe magnetic compass was not known of in Europe during the Viking age. And it would have been quite useless for them anyway, because the magnetic field of the Earth is far from homogeneous. The phenomenon by which the magnetic poles do not align well with the geographical ones is called \u2018magnetic declination\u2019. In addition, magnetic field lines are strongly curved. And both properties of the magnetic field change with time (Figure 13). Measuring campaigns like the one using ESA\u2019s SWARM satellites constantly monitor the magnetic field (European Space Agency, 2013).\n\nThus, especially at high latitudes, the Vikings would have lost their way using a magnetic compass more often than they would have found the correct course. But it seems that they were able to find the cardinal directions using the Sun instead.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Picture2.png)\n**Figure 13:** Change in the magnetic North Pole and its position relative to Scandinavia (Credit: Created with the NOAA Historical Magnetic Declination Viewer, http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/).\n\n<br/>\nIn 1948, fragments of a small wooden disk were found during historic excavations of the abandoned monastery of Uunartoq in southwest Greenland (Figure 14). In the following decades, people started to believe that it was a navigational tool to determine the cardinal directions using the Sun (Thirslund, 2007). However, even to date, there are doubts that it truly served that purpose. Nonetheless, remarkable scientific analyses demonstrate that in fact this disk could have been a combination of a sundial, a compass and a sun shadow board (Bern\u00e1th, Blah\u00f3, Egri, Barta, & Horv\u00e1th, 2013).\n\nEngraved lines have been identified as the paths of the shadow cast by a central gnomon during the days of equinox and summer solstice at a latitude of 61\u00b0 north. These lines hypothetically helped to determine local noon, when the Sun attains its highest elevation when crossing the meridian. This moment is the time when the device should be used. At local noon, the central gnomon produces a shadow that points north. Similar to the sun shadow board mentioned above, incisions on the wooden board toward the northern direction can be used to determine possible deviations from the course along a predefined latitude.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/suncompass.png)\n**Figure 14:** Image of the original wooden disk fragment found in Uunartoq, Greenland. The annotations denote the elements required for its possible use as a sun compass (Bern\u00e1th et al., 2013). When the shadow is aligned with the shadow lines, north is up. Incisions in that direction allow one to measure the shadow length (Credit: Lennart Larsen, Danish National Museum, http://samlinger.natmus.dk/DO/10775, \u2018Tr\u00e6disk_Gr\u00f8nland\u2019, background of photograph removed and annotations added by Markus Nielbock, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\n**Local time and time zones**<br/>\nThe shadow of the gnomon is the shortest and points north whenever the Sun is exactly south (northern hemisphere). This is what defines local noon. Since the Earth rotates continuously, the apparent position of the Sun changes as well. This means that at any given point in time, local noon is actually defined for one longitude only. However, clocks show a different time. Among other effects, this is due to daylight saving time during the summer and the time zones (Figure 15). Here, noon occurs simultaneously at many longitudes. However, it is obvious that the Sun cannot transit the meridian at all those places at the same time. Therefore, the times provided by common clocks are detached from the \u2018natural\u2019 local time a sundial shows.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/Standard_World_Time_Zones.png)\n**Figure 15:** World time zones. Instead of local time that is based on the apparent course of the Sun in the sky and valid for single longitudes only, common clocks show a time based on time zones, which applies to many longitudes simultaneously (Credit: TimeZonesBoy, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_World_Time_Zones.png, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).\n\n<br/>\n**Glossary**<br/>\n*Apparent movement*<br/>\nMovement of celestial objects which, in fact, is caused by the rotation of the Earth\n\n*Cardinal directions*<br/>\nMain directions, i.e. north, south, west and east\n\n*Circumpolar*<br/>\nProperty of celestial objects that never set below the horizon\n\n*Culmination*<br/>\nPassing the meridian of celestial objects.

They will build their own navigational tool, test its functionality and simulate a voyage from southern Scandinavia to Greenland. Imagine not getting lost on the wide ocean without any modern device like GPS receivers in a smartphone. In addition, they will learn about the history of the Vikings, who built the most advanced ships of their time in Europe.\n\n###**INTRODUCTION**\nIt would be useful if the activity were introduced in the larger context of seafaring, e.g. in geography, history, literature, etc.\n\nTip: This activity could be combined with other forms of acquiring knowledge like giving oral presentations on history, literature or geography with navigation as the highlight. This would prepare the field in a much more interactive way than what a teacher can achieve by summarising the facts.\n\nTip: There are good documentaries available on the Vikings and sea exploration that could be shown as introductory material. Some suggestions are as follows:\n\nHistory Channel | The Vikings [New] HD (Duration: 1:28:22)<br/>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkib3lYA2s\n\nVikings, The Founders of Europe (Duration: 50:32)<br/>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jngPAIGrzJs\n\nBuilding a Viking Ship (Duration: 1:46)<br/>\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78kpzwGmBxk\n\n###**QUESTIONS, ANSWERS AND DISCUSSION**\nAsk the students if they know how long mankind has been using ships to travel the oceans. One may point out the spread of Homo sapiens to islands and isolated continents like Australia.\n\nPossible answers:<br/>\nWe know for sure that ships have been used to cross large distances since 3,000 BCE or earlier. However, the early settlers of Australia must have found a way to cross the oceans around 50,000 BCE. Recent discoveries even seem to indicate that the Mediterranean island of Crete was already inhabited 130,000 years ago.\n\nAsk the students what the benefits to trying to explore the seas could have been. Perhaps someone knows historic cultures or peoples that were famous sailors. The teacher can support this with a few examples of ancient seafaring peoples, e.g. from the Mediterranean, and the art of navigation.\n\nPossible answers:<br/>\nFinding new resources and food, for trade, the spirit of exploration and curiosity.\n\nAsk the students how they find their way to school every day. What supports their ability to not get lost? As soon as reference points (buildings, traffic lights, bus stops, etc.) are mentioned, ask the students how navigators were able to find their way on the seas. In early times, they used sailing directions in connection to landmarks that could be recognised. But for this, the ships would have to stay close to the coast. Lighthouses provided a solution. But what could be used as reference points in the open sea? The students will probably mention celestial objects like the Sun, the Moon and stars.\n\n###**STORY**\nLet the students read the story of Galmi the Viking, which is available as a separate document.\n\n**Questions about the story**<br/>\nQ: What is Galmi\u2019s job?<br/>\nA: He is a farmer.\n\nQ: Why does he want to go on a raid?<br/>\nA: Harvests have been poor. He needs resources to buy seeds.\n\nQ: Who is leading the crew of sailors that Galmi joins?<br/>\nA: Ragnar\n\nQ: What is their destination? Do you know its modern name?<br/>\nA: Inbhir Nis, which is the old Gaelic name of Inverness\n\nQ: What propulsion devices do longships have?<br/>\nA: Oars and sails\n\nQ: How do the Vikings protect themselves against heavy rainfall on the open seas?<br/>\nA: A linen tent\n\nQ: How does Floki determine the course?<br/>\nA: He uses a shadow board to determine their latitude.\n\nQ: How does the crew know that the coast is near?<br/>\nA: They observe seagulls and smell smoke.\n\nQ: Do longships need anchors to dock?<br/>\nA: No, longships are shallow enough to be beached.\n\n###**ACTIVITY: A GAME OF SHADOWS **\nThis activity employs the educational tool \u2018Parallel Earth\u2019 (http://www.unawe.org/resources/books/\nParallel_Earth/), which demonstrates on a model level the phenomena related to the Sun illuminating the Earth. The students produce a miniature version of a shadow board and experiment with it.\n\nIf there are not many globes available, the teacher may choose to introduce this activity as a demonstration with only one globe. However, there are inflatable globes available for just a few Euros that can be distributed among the students. In that case, let them work in groups of two.\n\n**Building a miniature shadow board**\n1.\tUse the compass to draw three concentric circles with radii of 1, 1.5 and 2 cm on a piece of cardboard.\n2.\tCut the disc along the circle with a radius of 2 cm.\n3.\tCut a 2-cm-long piece from the toothpick.\n4.\tRun it through the centre of the cardboard disc and glue it. Make sure that it remains perpendicular to the surface of the disc. The two rings on the disc must be on the same side as the stick (Figure 16).\n5.\tLet the glue dry.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ShadowBoardMini.jpg)\n**Figure 16:** Miniature shadow board made of cardboard and a toothpick. Left: side view, right: top view (own work).\n\n<br/>\n**Part 1: Shadows**<br/>\nPut the shadow board on the desk. Before starting any experiments, answer the following questions:\n\nQ: When you illuminate the shadow board, how will the shadow cast by the stick behave when the position of the lamp is changed? What will be the direction of the shadow relative to the lamp?<br/>\nA: It always points away from the lamp.\n\nQ: How will the shadow change when you hold the lamp high or low?<br/>\nA: The higher the lamp is held, the shorter the shadow will be.\n\nTake a lamp and illuminate the shadow board. Change the position of the lamp relative to the board and observe how the shadow changes.\n\nCompare your observations to your predictions. Did the shadow behave as you anticipated? Discuss this with your classmates:\n\nQ: Imagine that the lamp represents the Sun. Where does the shadow point to when the Sun is south (northern hemisphere)/north (southern hemisphere) of you?<br/>\nA: The shadow points north (northern hemisphere)/south (southern hemisphere).\n\nQ: How would you be able to find south when observing the path of the Sun during the day?<br/>\nA: The Sun attains its highest point in the sky at noon, that is, when it is in the south. The shadow is shortest throughout the day. Therefore, when observing the shadow, one can determine when the Sun is in the south.\n\nQ: Imagine that the lamp represents the Sun. Are the shadows longer in winter or summer? Explain.<br/>\nA: As the Sun attains lower elevations above the horizon during the winter, this the season in which the shadows are longer.\n\n**Part 2: Navigate**<br/>\nThe Vikings travelled between Scandinavia and Greenland. Figure 5 shows that when they embarked from southern Norway and travelled along the 61st northern latitude, they would end up at the southern tip of Greenland. It is quite likely that at least during parts of such a voyage, they used the shadow board as a navigational tool.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ExpSetup1.png)\n**Figure 17:** The lamp that represents the Sun illuminates the globe. Northern summer is achieved when the axis of the globe and the line connecting it with the lamp subtend an angle smaller than 90\u00b0 (own work).\n\n<br/>\nTo simulate the point of embarkment, attach the miniature shadow board with Blu Tack on the globe at the southern tip of Norway. Since the Vikings predominantly sailed during summer, the angle between the axis of the globe and the connecting line to the lamp should be less than a right angle (90\u00b0, see Figure 17), although this is not very important for the purpose of this exercise. The easiest way to do this is to keep the North Pole up.\n\nImportant: Try to keep the orientation between the lamp and the Earth\u2019s axis stable.\n\nIn the beginning, place the globe in a position such that the shadow on the shadow board points up, that is, to the North Pole. Adjust the distance between the globe and the lamp until the shadow touches one of the rings (inner ring in Figure 18).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ShadowBoard_Pos1.jpg)\n**Figure 18:** Starting position of the shadow board with the gnomon located at southern Norway (own work).\n\n<br/>\nQ: What is the local time of the day when the lamp (the Sun), the shadow board and the axis of the globe (Earth) are aligned? From the perspective of the shadow board on the Earth, where would the Sun be in the sky?<br/>\nA: The Sun just passes the meridian, that is, it is due south. Therefore, the time situation is local noon.\n\nQ: How would you be able to derive the cardinal directions from this measurement?<br/>\nA: After realising that the shadow points north at local noon, the other cardinal directions can be easily derived accordingly.\n\nWhile maintaining the orientation of the globe, rotate it around its axis and watch how the shadow changes.\n\nTip: If an inflatable globe is used, its orientation can be fixed by mounting it on a bowl.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ShadowBoard_Time.jpg)\n**Figure 19:** Change in the shadow for situations after (left) and before local noon (right). The orientation of the shadow indicates time (own work, not presented to the students).\n\n<br/>\nQ: Which situation corresponds to the configuration in which the shadow board is west of the previous orientation of the globe?<br/>\nA: This is the morning.\n\nQ: How does the shadow change?<br/>\nA: It turns away from the previous direction and becomes longer.\n\nQ: When is the shadow the shortest?<br/>\nA: At local noon\n\nNow, return to the initial configuration. Then change the latitude of the starting position by moving the shadow board north and south.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ShadowBoard_Latitude.jpg)\n**Figure 20:** Change in the shadow during local noon for situations more northern (left) and more southern (right) than the initial position. The length of the shadow at noon indicates latitude (own work, not presented to the students).\n\n<br/>\nQ: How does the shadow change?<br/>\nA: The length changes. It is shorter for more southern positions and longer for more northern positions.\n\nYou will now simulate a voyage to the southern tip of Greenland. During each measurement with the shadow board, adjust the globe such that it indicates local noon for the board.\n\nNow put the shadow board at a position west along the current latitude. Rotate the globe until the shadow points north.\n\nQ: How did the Vikings know when the shadow pointed north? The answer is in the length of the shadow.<br/>\nA: They had to observe the length of the shadow. When it was the shortest, it was local noon, and the Sun was in the south. The shadow then pointed north.\n\nRepeat this procedure a few times until you reach the southern tip of Greenland. Ensure that the tilt of the axis is kept constant.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ShadowBoard_Voyage.jpg)\n**Figure 21:** Functionality of the shadow board when travelling west along a latitude. When measured at local noon, the orientation and the length of the shadow remain the same (own work, not presented to the students).\n\n<br/>\nQ: Explain why the length of the shadow during local noon is always the same anywhere on the same latitude.<br/>\nA: The configuration between the lamp (the Sun) and any position on a given latitude is always the same. Rotating the globe (Earth) does not change the angle at which the shadow board is illuminated.\n\nThe Math of the Shadow Board (optional, for higher terms; trigonometric functions needed)\nThis topic is an interesting application of simple trigonometry. Therefore, the example of the shadow board can be used to reinforce trigonometric principles.\n\nFor simplicity, the calculations assume that\n- The Sun is above the equator (equinox).\n- The radius of the Earth is negligible in comparison to its distance from the Sun.\n- It is local noon at the location of the shadow board.\n- The local horizon at the position of the shadow board is flat.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ExpSetup2.png)\n**Figure 22:** Sketch that represents the illumination of a gnomon by the Sun at a certain latitude on the Earth. For simplicity, the Sun is assumed to be located above the equator (equinox). Local noon is assumed (own work).\n\n<br/>\nThe basic configuration of the Sun and Earth is shown in Figure 22. There is a gnomon (i.e. the shadow board) extending from the surface of the Earth that when illuminated by the Sun, casts a shadow. Since the radius of the Earth is small compared to it distance from the Sun, the rays of light hitting the equator and the gnomon are considered to be parallel to each other (Figure 23).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/98f1210b-2448-48c7-b6d5-b0786a333455/ExpSetup3.png)\n**Figure 23:** Sketch that demonstrates the geometric relations of a gnomon (stick) of height h at latitude \u03c6 that when illuminated by the Sun, casts a shadow of the length \u2113. For simplicity, the Sun is located above the equator (equinox). The local horizon is assumed to be flat (own work).\n\n<br/>\nSince the local plane that forms the horizon at the position of the shadow board is a tangent at the surface of the Earth, the gnomon and the plane subtend a right angle. The height of the gnomon is h and the length of the shadow is \u2113.\n\nTherefore one can simply calculate the length of the shadow when using the tangent function with h and \u2113 being the two catheti (legs adjacent to the right angle). Since in this example, when the Sun is above the equator and the declination is zero, the angular height (elevation) is identical to the latitude. The geometry in of Figure 23 shows that the latitude \u03c6 is also the angle opposite \u2113. Therefore,\n\ntan\u2061\u03c6 = l/h\n\n\nAs a task, develop Figure 23 with the entire class or group.\n\nOur local coordinate system that extends to the horizon is a tangent that touches the surface of the Earth. When viewed from the side, this area appears like a line that touches the circumference of the Earth \u2013 a circle.\n\nQ: What is the angle between a tangent and the line connecting it to the centre of the circle?<br/>\nA: It is a right angle.\n\nLet them identify the right triangle.\n\nQ: What is the trigonometric function that describes the relation between \u2113 and h?<br/>\nA: The tangent.\n\nQ: If h = 10 cm, what is the length of the shadow \u2113 at latitudes of \u03c6 = 40\u00b0 and 60<sup>\u00b0</sup>?<br/>\nA: tan\u2061\u03c6 = l/h \u21d4 l = h\u2219tan\u2061\u03c6 = 8.4 cm and 17.3 cm\n\n###**CONCLUSIONS**\nQ: Why does the shortest shadow during the day point north (northern hemisphere)?<br/>\nA: The shadow is the shortest when the Sun is highest during the day. In the northern hemisphere, this is when the Sun transits the meridian, when it is exactly south. The shadow then points north.\n\nQ: What time was it when the Sun was in the south (northern hemisphere)?<br/>\nA: Probably not 1200 h or noon.\n\nQ: Why does the clock show a time other than 1200 h at local noon when the Sun attains its highest elevation?<br/>\nA: Time zones, daylight saving time, equation of time (bonus knowledge)\n\nQ: The length of the shadow at local noon changes throughout the year. Why?<br/>\nA: The declination of the Sun changes. This is because the Earth revolves around the Sun on a titled axis. From the surface of the Earth, the Sun appears to be alternating between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. This modifies the elevation of the Sun seen from any point on Earth.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "", "conclusion": "The activity shows how the cardinal directions can be determined with the shadow cast by a gnomon illuminated by the Sun during the day.

In 1933, a Swiss astronomer, Fritz Zwicky tried to measure the total mass of a galaxy cluster by summing the mass of each individual visible galaxy in the cluster. He found out that their total mass was not enough to create the observed gravity that holds the galaxies together to form a cluster. With just the gravity created by all of their visible matter, the galaxies would not cluster easily, if at all. Thus, Zwicky concluded that there must be something invisible, inside and around the galaxies. This matter adds the extra mass to create that gravity, strong enough to form a galaxy cluster. Zwicky called this unseen mass, dark matter.\n<br/>\nMore evidence for dark matter has emerged over time. Photographs of galaxies showed that most of their light, i.e. most of their stars, were concentrated near the center of the galaxies. Therefore, most of the mass of a galaxy must be concentrated in its center, meaning that gravity is stronger at the center of a galaxy than in the outskirt. Because of this, it is expected that the stars near the center of the galaxy would move faster than those farther away. However, the measurements indicated that the orbital speed of stars was the same everywhere, regardless of their distance from the center. The conclusion is that there must be invisible matter that spreads throughout a galaxy, such that stars far away from the center will feel the gravitational pull of not only the central material, but all the other matter between them. The extra force of gravity from dark matter can cause them to speed up roughly to the same speed of the stars near the center.\n<br/>\nThe existence of Dark Matter is evident through an optical illusion, called gravitational lensing, seen as a result of light being bent by the gravity generated by dark matter. When viewing distant galaxies with telescopes, astronomers observed strange rings and arcs of light coming from a distant source, despite no observation of any mass. Light normally travels straight in space. The presence of mass creates gravity. Einstein  discovered that gravity is the same as curvature of space, which causes light to travel along this curvature, instead of going in a straight line, i.e. light is bent. Therefore, the mass acts as a lens, called a gravitational lens, bending any light passing by. This indicates the presence of invisible mass that is creating the gravity and the phenomenon. Hence, dark matter can also be indirectly observed through gravitational lensing.\n<br/>\nAlthough it\u2019s been discovered for some time, it\u2019s still unknown what dark matter really is. Scientists have proposed various ideas and designed experiments to test those ideas. However, the quest to define dark matter has, thus far,mainly been a process of elimination. Experiments have ruled out potential candidates, such as black holes, brown dwarfs, neutron stars, which are invisible or difficult to detect, but are not numerous enough to account for the additional mass in the Universe. \n<br/>\nA current leading hypothesis is that dark matter is made of something different from the normal matter because it is invisible and does not interact with other normal matter that we are familiar with. Scientists think dark matter might be made of particles predicted by theory (exotic particles), however, they have been unable to find these particles yet. Scientists have also been trying to generate dark matter particles in large underground experiments where  avoid contamination by other \u201cnormal\u201d particles Can be avoided. In the absence of discovery of dark matter particles, some researchers suggest that the effects of dark matter could be explained by fundamentally modifying the theory of gravity. This idea proposes that at the scale of the Universe, gravity may act differently than on Earth, creating the effect that scientists interpret as dark matter. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Dark energy** <br/>\nSomething even more mysterious, called dark energy, makes up 70% of the Universe, besides normal matter and dark matter. Normal and dark matter generate gravity which holds things together. Dark energy is completely opposite to gravity; it causes things to be pushed apart. To understand dark energy, think about what happens when you toss a ball up into the air. It goes up and gradually slows down due to the pull of gravity. Eventually, the ball stops in mid-air and falls back to the ground. Now imagine a ball, once tossed up, keeps flying up further and further, faster and faster, instead of being attracted back down to the ground. This event seems impossible to happen, but this is the property of dark energy.\n <br/>\nIn the 1990s, dark energy was discovered as astronomers observed such a peculiar effect in distant galaxies within the Universe. Scientists know that Universe has continually expanded, with galaxies moving away from each other, since its formation at the Big Bang. They also observed that the speed of expansion has increased, which is unexpected, because like the tossed ball, the expansion was expected to slow down as gravity pulled on all of the galaxies. Scientists had suspected that the Universe would stop expanding and finally collapse, if gravity won and halted the expansion. Scientists concluded that the accelerated expansion cannot be caused by dark matter and normal matter, which generate gravity for the Universe, but must be by some form of mysterious energy that acts as an force opposite to gravity. As it is invisible, they called it dark energy. Remember that the Universe has always been expanding; dark energy acts to accelerate this expansion. By measuring how fast the Universe is expanding over time, which is a combined effect of dark matter pulling galaxies together and dark energy pushing them apart, astronomers can determine the proportion between dark energy and dark matter.\n<br/>\nScientists have many theories, but no concrete answer yet, for the nature of dark energy. The different theories for dark energy differ in the way they predict the expansion of the Universe with time. Scientists are trying to take more accurate measurements of the acceleration of the Universe, to see which theory best explains dark energy and hope to understand what Dark Energy is. One other possibility suggested by some scientists is that maybe Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity is flawed and there is no dark energy after all. However, no one has been able to improve on Einstein\u2019s theory such that it can explain the effects of dark energy and also fit other phenomena of gravity. Dark energy remains one of the greatest mysteries of the Universe. If one day we understand dark energy, it will change what we already know and the way we think about the Universe.\n \n", "fulldesc": "###**Introduction: (3 min)**\n1.\tTo do this activity, the students need to have undertaken the first activity, part 1 (Discovering the main components of the Universe (Secondary school)).

The Sun is in the center of the system, it is the most massive and creates a strong gravity for other planets to orbit. Ask students what they expect for the speed of the innermost planets compared to the planets more at the edge in the Solar system. They should expect the planets closer to the Sun to orbit faster than those further.\n4.\tTell the students that the effect of gravity is seen as it causes objects to move and orbit. Recap from the previous session, they know dark matter is invisible mass. Ask the students to discuss and suggest how to prove dark matter existence, if the only observable effect is its gravity. \n5.\tHelp the students to get to the answer. By observing any irregular or unexpected orbit of stars in a galaxy, we can follow the trail of dark matter, left by its gravity. Scientists also often base their conclusions on what they can observe to deduce about what cannot be seen.\n6.\tTell the students that in a galaxy, most of the stars cluster near the center (use slideshow or printed image). Thus, most of the mass of the galaxy looks like it is concentrated at its center. The students would expect the stars near the center to orbit faster than those more at the edge. \n7.\tTell the students that in fact, unexpectedly all of the stars move at similar speed everywhere in the galaxy, similar to beads flowing in water. \n8.\tFill an empty washbowl with water. Just before throwing some beads into the water, paint some watercolor on the beads. Gently stir the water (avoid create a vortex) and throw in the beads. Observe the trails of color created by the beads. \n9.\tStudents compare flow speed of the beads at the edge and in the center of the bowl. The beads flow around in similar speed everywhere. Students then try to explain that because of the uniform distribution of water, the movement is the same everywhere in water. \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/0715efdb-3863-4ddb-ba84-41a2cdce37a8/Instruction image 2.gif) \n<br/>\n<br/>\n10.\tHelp the students to relate the two observations to prove the existence of dark matter. They should indicate that the unexpected uniform orbital speed of stars in galaxy reflects the acting of some invisible mass influencing gravity. Water in the activity acts like dark matter, invisible and evenly spreads across the galaxy. It causes uniform gravitational pull throughout a galaxy, causing what we observe with star orbital speed. This is a further evidence for the existence of dark matter in Universe.\n\n###**Part 2: Gravitational lensing (10 min)**\n1.\tExplain to the students that scientists can indirectly observe dark matter as its gravity bends light. Use the background information to explain how light is bent by gravity. \n2.\tStudents then undertake this activity to understand how gravity bends light. Use some tape and create a straight line on a table surface. This represents light, which travels straight in space. Remind students about the stretchy sheet-wash bowl experiment. Something with mass will bend down the sheet i.e. creating gravity. Use a saucer to represent this curved space. \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/0715efdb-3863-4ddb-ba84-41a2cdce37a8/Instruction image 3.jpg)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3.\tPartly remove and lift up one end of the tape that was pasted on the table, place the saucer (upside down) where the tape was before. Put down the tape and paste it again on the surface that is within its path (i.e. the saucer and the table). The tape cannot be pasted smoothly in a straight line as before, but has to be bent; only then it can be pasted smoothly on the saucer surface and on the table surface.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/0715efdb-3863-4ddb-ba84-41a2cdce37a8/Instruction image 4.jpg)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tLight being bent by gravity is a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Show an image of gravitational lensing (using the accompaning slideshow or printed image). The presence of dark matter bends space, which can act like a lens, bending light from a distant source as it passes by.\n5.\tPlace a candle on a cup and use a wine glass to see the candle through the base of the glass. The candle is a distant light source. The base of wine glass acts as gravitational lens.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/0715efdb-3863-4ddb-ba84-41a2cdce37a8/Instruction image 5.JPG)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6.\tHelp students to adjust the glass to see the candle light being distorted and forming a ring or arc of light. The distorted images mimic the gravitational lensing phenomenon observed by telescope.  Emphasize that the glass base is not really creating gravity. It just represents the effect of something \u201cinvisible\u201d, like dark matter in front of the distant light source, distorting the path of the light before reaches us.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/0715efdb-3863-4ddb-ba84-41a2cdce37a8/Picture1.png)\n7.\tTell the students that the presence of telescope images showing gravitational lensing, despite no observation of any object, indicates that there must be invisible mass creating the gravity. Hence, dark matter can be indirectly detected by the effect of gravitational lensing.\n\n###**Part 3: What are dark matter and dark energy? (15 min)** \n1.\tIt remains a mystery as to what dark matter really is, because it is invisible and does not interact with other normal matter that we know. Show some examples. \n2.\tTurn off and on the light in the classroom allows visualization of objects and people. Dark matter does not interact with light to be seen.  \n3.\tMagnets allow detection of a hidden nail stuck on the back of a cardboard. Dark matter is not magnetic to be detected. \n4.\tUse an X-ray image to show how X-ray, although invisible to naked eye, is absorbed in body and can be detected to create an image. Dark matter does not interact nor get absorbed. It cannot be detected at all.\n5.\tTell students that scientists have worked to eliminate many possible candidates of dark matter and they will play a small game to demonstrate. Print out each of the following notes in large fonts (so that the entire class can read). In each of these notes, some space objects are written as possible candidates for dark matter. There are descriptions and facts about each candidate. <br/>\n<br/>\n**BLACK HOLES**<br/>Result after large stars die (collapse). <br/> Have extreme gravity that captures anything that comes too close and prevents them from escaping. <br/> Even light is trapped inside black hole, that\u2019s why black holes are invisible.  <br/>\n<br/>\n**NEUTRON STARS**<br/>Result after large stars die (collapse). <br/>Smallest and densest stars known to exist. <br/>A neutron star can be very small but has the mass of about twice the Sun.<br/>Rare. <br/>\n<br/>\n**BROWN DWARFS**<br/>Failed stars - lack enough mass needed to start burning. <br/>Emit no visible light. <br/>Rare. <br/>\n<br/>\n**EXOTIC PARTICLES **<br/> Exist in theories. <br/> Has mass. <br/> Interact very weakly with light and other normal matter.<br/> Invisible and undetectable. <br/>\n<br/>\n6.\tA student blind-picks a note and paste it on the blackboard. As the class reads, they discuss and decide if that is the best candidate of dark matter and why. Then choose another note to discuss. They can change their decision about the previous candidate as they go through the notes.\n<br/>Note:<br/> \n*If students need help, tell them that the hints are the bold-italic words. They can base on these words to form their explanations and arguments why this candidate should or should not be dark matter.*\n<br/>\n7.\tOnce all the notes have been discussed and students have chosen their dark matter candidate, use background information to explain why black holes, neutron stars and brown dwarfs were eliminated, although they are invisible or difficult to detect. Because black holes and neutron stars are remnants of dead stars, so they are made of normal matter. Brown dwarfs are also made of normal matter as they are simply failed stars that cannot burn and shine. But dark matter does not react as normal matter. Moreover, these objects don\u2019t exist in enough quantity to account for the 25% mass of dark matter.\n8.\tUse background information to explain about exotic particles and the ongoing research of dark matter. Also use background information to explain about the research trying to define dark energy. Then, emphasize to students the fluid nature of science work. It involves testing, finding evidence, eliminating alternative explanations to finally have an answer. Importantly, keeping an open mind about changing one\u2019s own ideas is part of being a good scientist.\n\n###**Part 4: Wrap up (5 min)**\n1.\tConclude that it is still a mystery for what dark matter and dark energy really are. But there have been substantial proofs to support their existence. \n2.\tGo through the entire activity with the students to point out how they have worked like a scientist. Working in the field of science means there will always be unexpected results, which must be carefully recorded as they may signal for something new to be discovered. To solve the mysteries, it requires observation, deduction, making hypothesis based on observation and available knowledge, and finding proof to support one\u2019s idea.

Everything with mass has gravity. We perceive gravity when we jump up and get pulled back down to the ground. Planets, stars, moons and other objects in the Universe have gravity. That\u2019s why they orbit around each other, like for example the Earth orbits the Sun or the moon orbits around the Earth, instead of flying randomly in space. That\u2019s why we see the moon and the Sun every day. \n\nThe more mass something has, the stronger the gravity it produces. The Earth\u2019s gravity is stronger than the Moon\u2019s because it is more massive. So our bodies are pulled down on Earth more than if we were on the Moon. That\u2019s why astronauts can jump higher and more easily on the moon than on Earth. Our bodies also exert gravitational forces on other objects, but because our mass is so small, the gravity from our bodies does not affect objects any way we can see. The strength of gravity also changes with the distance to an object. The pull between the Earth and the moon is stronger than that between the Earth and Jupiter. This is because the Earth is closer to the Moon than to Jupiter.\n \nGravity was first described by Newton as a force. Described more than 300 years ago, Newton\u2019s theory of gravity is still applied today and it was used when scientists plotted the course to land man on the moon and is still used to build bridges across rivers. Although Newton\u2019s theory describes the strength of gravity fairly accurately, he didn\u2019t know what caused gravity or how it worked. These concepts remained unknown for nearly 250 years, until Albert Einstein described gravity as the curvature of space. Space has 3 dimensions: up-down, left-right and forward-backward; and it can be visualized as a fabric, like a stretchy sheet. Any object with mass deforms space, just like a marble creating a dimple on the surface of the stretchy sheet. This curvature of space causes objects to interact with each other, often by moving towards each other, which is seen as gravity, a natural consequence of a mass\u2019s influence on space. The more mass something has, the more the space is curved, and, therefore, the more gravity there is.\n\n**Black hole**<br/>\nA black hole is a region in space where the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. A black hole can be very very small in size but can contain a lot of mass. Some black holes are a result of dying giant stars, several to hundreds times bigger than our Sun. At the end of its life, the star burns out and collapses, causing some of the material from the dead star to be compressed into a tiny space. Such compression of enormous mass bends space so much it acts like a deep well. The result is the formation of what we call black holes, characterized by extreme gravity. Because its mass is so concentrated, another object can get very close to the black hole, to where the space is greatly curved, and gets trapped forever in this gravitational well. \n\nBlack holes do not necessarily have more mass than other objects in the Universe but the compression of its mass creates its extreme gravity near to it. After its formation, black holes can continue to grow more massive as they accumulate more matter from its surroundings, such as stars, gas, dust and other black holes. Black holes can be as massive as three Suns to over a million Suns. Things that enter into the black holeare lost forever once they pass the border of no escape - the event horizon. As we get closer to a black hole, space is bent more and more, and gravity becomes more extreme very rapidly. The event horizon is the boundary region of black hole where the pull of gravity becomes so extreme that nothing, not even light, can escape. It is thought that there are around 100 million stellar-mass black holes orbiting within our own galaxy.\n\n**Black hole observation**<br/>\nBecause of their extreme gravity, black holes are perfect space traps. Light travels extremely fast (nothing can travel faster), only taking 1.3 second to travel between the moon and the Earth. If we moved at the speed of light, we could travel around the Earth 7.5 times just in one second. Therefore, the pull of gravity in a black hole must be extremely high if light cannot escape from it. As light enters a black hole there is no path out and remains inside. This is why a black hole is invisible and very difficult for astronomers to detect. However, there are still some ways for black holes to be detected. \n\nWhen a black hole is feeding on matter within its vicinity, that material can become very bright, allowing its detection, in a phenomenon called an accretion disk. A black hole\u2019s extreme gravity causes nearby material to be pulled into it; this material can include small amounts of gas from a nearby star, or the dust and other stellar debris from a complete star being torn apart. As this material spirals closer into the black hole, it orbits faster and rubs and collides against other material spiraling into the hole. The friction created causes the material to be heated to very high temperatures. Wherever there is heat, there is emission of thermal electromagnetic radiation, which is light. An example is our body, which also emits thermal radiation and this can be seen when looking through thermal imaging goggles. Another example is when a piece of metalwork is heated to very high temperature that we can see the heated part glow. \n\nWhen the temperature of the material around the black hole increases, the energy emitted in the form of radiation also increases. Because the materials spiraling in black hole get extremely heated, they glow and form a bright flattened ring of spinning matter, called an accretion disk, around the event horizon. Although black holes are themselves invisible, this accretion disk can be seen by astronomers because the spiraling materials have yet to pass the event horizon to be lost forever. The light from the accretion disk radiates out into the universe and allows us to see where a black hole is and what it is doing to its surroundings. As the material spirals in, when it is very close to the black hole but before it goes beyond the event horizon, some of it can be shot out in the form of super-fast, focused beams of material, called \u2018jets\u2019. \n\nFor black holes that are not feeding on surrounding material and cannot be observed via their accretion disks, the presence of a black hole can be revealed by the effect of its gravity on normal stars that apparently orbit around nothing. This is like planets keeping their orbit around the Sun. But instead of something visible like our Sun, the stars just orbit around an empty space. Thus astronomers can assume that there is a black hole there. This happens at the centre of our own galaxy, where we see stars, such as star S2, orbiting fast around an invisible point.\n\nAdditionally, the existence of a black hole can be evident through an optical effect, called gravitational lensing, seen as the result of light being bent by the gravity generated by black hole. Light normally travels straight in space. But due to a black hole\u2019s extreme gravity, which is the curvature of space, light passing nearby a black hole will travel along this curvature, instead of going straight through, i.e. light is bent. Therefore, a black hole can act as a lens, bending any light passing behind it. When viewing distant galaxies with telescopes, astronomers have observed strange rings and arcs of light, despite no observation of any visible mass. This indicates the presence of invisible black hole that is creating curvature due to gravity and focusing the light towards us like a lens.\n \n", "fulldesc": "The activity is divided in 4 parts. For the first 3 parts, at beginning of each part, the teacher can explain the concept behind the part and then let students attempt the activity on their own, following the student worksheet. After a specified amount of time, the teacher discusses and demonstrates (if needed) with the students,  steps in the activity they just undertook and provide more elaboration. Only for part 4, would it be better that the teacher demonstrates the activity as the students follow. Decide which is the best classroom setting for the end of part 4,when candles are used, to ensure clear understanding and also safety. \n\n###**Introduction: (3 min)**\n1.\tAsk students what they already know about black holes. Use the background information provided to explain, in a simple manner, black holes, emphasizing their ability to contain enormous amount of material (from three to billions of times the mass of the Sun) and how they capture anything that comes too close and prevent them from escaping. \n2.\tUse the background information provided to tell students some fun facts about how light is the fastest thing in the universe. After this, point out that even light can never escape from black hole because of black hole\u2019s extreme gravity warping the space around it.  \n\n###**Part 1: Black holes have powerful gravity (7 min)**\n1.\tElicit discussion on what the students think gravity is. Use background information to explain the concept of gravity as an attractive force and that this attraction can be explained as a result of space being bent by an object.\n2.\tCover a stretchy sheet on a large round bowl. Introduce the surface of the sheet as a small portion of space and point out that this is only space in 2 dimensions because space surrounds us everywhere in all directions.\n3.\tRemind the students that some black holes can be more massive than a billion Suns so use the heaviest marble to represent a black hole. Students should observe that there is a bend on the sheet. Roll a lighter marble on the sheet past the heavier marble so that the lighter marble moves toward the heavier one, circling around it. \n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 1.gif)\n4.\tAlternatively, place the light marble in the center of the stretchy sheet. Children should observe the curve on the sheet is less than that created by the heavy marble before. Roll the heavy marble on the sheet. The light marble will follow the heavy one to fall towards it. \n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 2.gif)\n5.\tAsk students what causes the light marble to move and interact with the heavy marble? They should come to the conclusion that it is the curve of the sheet. Explain to them that this bending of space, causing objects to interact, is known as gravity. \n6.\tAsk students to point out which marble shows to have the strongest gravity. They should come to the conclusion that it is the heaviest marble because it bends space the most. Confirm that because a black hole has such extreme gravity it means that black hole bends nearby space more than many other objects, causing objects to fall into it and that the bending of space can be so extreme that these objects, even light which moves the fastest in Universe, cannot escape.\n <br/>\n*Because the heavy marble is bigger than the light marble, make it clear that in reality black holes can be much more massive than the other objects, but are generally much smaller in size.*\n\n###**Part 2: Observation of fed black hole - Accretion disk (5 min)**\n1.\tTell the students that because even light is trapped by black hole, the black hole itself is invisible. Use the background information (with the provided slideshow or image) to explain that light and other things are only lost forever in a black hole once they pass a certain boundary region - called the event horizon.\n2.\tTell the students that outside the event horizon, there are effects created by black hole\u2019s gravity that show the existence of the black hole, despite not being able to visibly see it.\n3.\tUse the accompanied documents (slideshow or image) and background information to explain that an accretion disk is an indirect way to observe a black hole. Emphasize that this is possible because materials have not yet passed the event horizon to be lost forever but are quickly spiraling in.\n4.\tPrepare in advance cardboard sheets as the following. On each cardboard sheet, draw thin lines of spirals with an orange highlighter. The spirals should be quite closely packed. Draw large bold dots on the spiral lines. In the center, poke a hole.\n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 3.JPG)\n5.\tProvide a cardboard sheet to each group. Explain that the center of the spiral is a black hole and that the dots are infalling materials (stars, gas, dust) outside the event horizon of the black hole.  Put a skewer through the center hole of the cardboard. Students spin the cardboard as fast as possible. \n6.\tHave the students observe that as the board spins, the spirals become almost like a disc of color that appears to be more visible than when it is stationary.<br/>\n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 4.gif)\n7.\tAsk students to relate this model with the phenomenon of an accretion disk . They should conclude that when spinning the cardboard, the dots are like materials falling in black hole, colliding and rubbing against each other vigorously due to the pull of black hole\u2019s gravity. They become heated up and the entire disk of spiraling material lights up. It is similar to how the spirals have formed into a brighter disc of color. \n\n###**Part 3: Observation of resting black hole (10 min)**\n1.\tPrepare in advance some cardboard and paste a few magnets close to each other on the back of the cardboard. Paste the back of this cardboard to another piece of cardboard to cover up the magnets. Make a few of such items, one for each group.<br/>\n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 5.jpg)\n2.\tTell the students that when a black hole is not \u2018eating\u2019 material to form accretion disk, there are other ways in which we can detect it, based on the effects of the black hole\u2019s gravity on nearby stars. Give each group a cardboard and a ball bearing. Ask them to locate the area of the hidden cluster of magnets within this cardboard. \n3.\tStudents should move the ball bearing around to track the area that they can feel the attraction on the ball bearing. This is where the magnets are pasted on the other side. Ask students to use chalk to trace the area where there is magnetic attraction on the ball bearing. The trail left by the chalk marks is where the magnet cluster is hidden in the cardboard. \n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 6a.gif) ![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 6b.JPG)\n4.\tAsk students to relate this activity with the effect of black hole on surrounding objects. The magnet is like the attraction by gravity of a black hole. The ball bearing is like a star nearby the black hole, gravitationally bound to keep orbiting around it. \n5.\tUse the background information (and accompanied slideshow) to explain to the students that because of black hole\u2019s gravity, nearby stars (but not too close to the event horizon) are attracted to orbit around an apparently empty space, but in fact they are orbiting around a black hole. So, although resting black holes are invisible, the effect of their gravity on nearby stars allows their observation. \n\n###**Part 4: Gravitational lensing (15 min)**\n1.\tExplain to the students that scientists can indirectly observe black hole as its gravity bends light.   \n2.\tDemonstrate to the students how gravity can bend light. Use tape to create a straight line on a table surface. This represents a ray of light, which travels straight in space.\n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 7.jpg)\n3.\tUse a saucer to represent the curvature of space. Partly remove and lift up one end of the tape and move the saucer (upside down) to where the tape was previously. Put down the tape, pasting it onto the surface that is in its path (i.e. the saucer and the table). The tape cannot be pasted smoothly in a straight line as before, but has to be bent; only then it can be pasted smoothly on the saucer surface and on the table surface. The tape will not look like it is following a straight line as before, but appears bent. \n4.\tUse this observation to explain how black hole bends light that passes nearby. Relate the saucer with curved space (which has been curved by the mass of black hole), meaning that light now travels on this curved space rather than a straight line, appearing to be bent by the black hole\u2019s gravity. \n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 8.jpg)\n5.\tTell students that light being bent by gravity is a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Show an image of gravitational lensing (located in the accompanied slideshow/ image file). The presence of a black hole bends space, which then can act like a lens, bending light from a distant source as it passes behind it.\n6.\tPlace a candle on a cup and use a wine glass to view the candle through the base of the glass. The candle is a distant light source. The base of wine glass acts as gravitational lens.\n![](/media/activities/attach/f0f0b202-d99a-4491-9747-cd52d764cc7e/Instruction image 9.JPG)\n7.\tThe candle light is distorted and forms a ring or arc of light. The distorted images mimic the gravitational lensing phenomenon observed by telescope.  Emphasize that the glass base is not really creating gravity.

Everything with mass has gravity. We perceive gravity as we jump up and get pulled down to the ground. Planets, stars, moons and other objects in the universe also have gravity (Even humans, rocks and tiny ants have gravity). That\u2019s why objects in space  orbit around each other.For example the Earth orbits the Sun, or the moon orbits around the Earth, instead of flying randomly in space. \n<br/>\n\nThe more mass something has, the stronger the force due to gravity it produces. The Earth\u2019s gravity is stronger than the Moon\u2019s because it is more massive. So our bodies are pulled down on Earth more than if we were on the Moon. That\u2019s why astronauts can jump higher and more easily on the moon than on Earth. Our bodies also exert gravitational forces on other objects, but because our mass is so small, the gravity from our bodies does not affect objects in any way we can see. The strength of the force of gravity also changes with the distance to an object. The pull between the Earth and the moon is stronger than that between the Earth and Jupiter, even though Jupiter is much more massive than the Moon. This is because the Earth is closer to the Moon than to Jupiter. \n\nGravity was first described by Newton as a force. Described more than 300 years ago, Newton\u2019s theory of gravity is still applied today when scientists plotted the course to land man on the moon or to build a bridge across a river. Although Newton\u2019s theory describes the strength of gravity fairly accurately, he didn\u2019t know what caused gravity or how it worked. These concepts were left unknown for nearly 250 years, until Albert Einstein described gravity as the curvature of space. Space has 3 dimensions: up-down, left-right and forward-backward; and it can be visualized as a fabric, like a stretchy sheet. Any object with mass deforms space, just like a marble creating a dimple on the surface of the stretchy sheet. This curvature of space causes objects to interact with each other, often by moving towards each other, which is seen as gravity, a natural consequence of a mass\u2019s influence on space. The more mass something has, the more the space is curved, and, therefore, the more gravity there is.\n\n**Black holes**<br/>\nA black hole is a region in space where the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Light travels extremely fast (nothing can travel faster), only taking 1.3 seconds to travel between the moon and the Earth. If we moved at the speed of light, we could travel around the Earth 7.5 times just in one second. Therefore, the pull of gravity in a black hole must be extremely high if light cannot escape from it. Because light cannot escape from a black hole, the black hole is invisible to us. \n\nA black hole is very very small in size but contains a lot of mass. Most black holes are a result of dying giant stars, several to hundreds times more massive than our Sun. At the end of its life, the star burns out and collapses, causing some of the material from the dead star to be compressed into a tiny space. Such compression of enormous mass bends space so much that it is like a deep well. The result is the formation of what we call black holes, characterized by extreme gravity. Because its mass is so concentrated, another object can get very close to the black hole, to where the space is greatly curved i.e. gravity is extreme, and gets trapped forever in this gravitational well. \n\nBlack holes do not necessarily have more mass than everything else in the Universe but the compression of its mass creates its extreme gravity. After its formation, black holes can continue to grow more massive as their extreme gravity causes them to accumulate more matter from its surroundings, such as other stars and other black holes. Black holes can even be as massive as more than a million suns; these are called \u201csupermassive\u201d black holes. These supermassive black holes exist at the centre of most galaxies. One even exists at the centre of the galaxy that we live in, the Milky Way; and it is thought that there are around 100 million less massive black holes about the mass of the Sun orbiting within our own galaxy.\n\nA common misconception is that black holes suck everything towards it, like a vacuum cleaner. However, things only enter into black hole and are lost forever once they pass the border of no escape of that black hole - the event horizon. As we get closer to a black hole, space is warped more and more and gravity becomes extreme very rapidly. The event horizon is the boundary region of black hole where gravity becomes too extreme that nothing, not even light, can escape. That the Earth would be be destroyed if the Sun became a black holes is a myth. First of all, as black holes are formed from the collapse of stars much more massive than our Sun, the sun would never become a black hole at the end of its life. But hypothetically, if it was replaced by a black hole with the same mass, the Earth wouldn\u2019t get drawn towards this black hole and destroyed. Instead, the Earth would keep the same pull due to gravity from this black hole, orbiting it in exactly the same way as it does the Sun. This is because the black hole will still have the same mass as the Sun; and because only very close to the black hole that the gravity becomes extreme, further away from it, the gravity acts exactly the same.\n \n", "fulldesc": "###**Introduction (7min)**\n1.\tAsk students what they already know about black holes and about a myth that black holes could \u2018suck\u2019 matter towards them and eventually consume everything in the Universe. If the Sun was replaced by a black hole, hypothetically, would it be able to destroy the Earth? Tell students that to investigate this possibility, they need to understand what a black hole is. \n2.\tUse the accompanied slideshow and background information to explain the characteristics of black holes. A black hole can be much smaller in size than the Sun but can also be more massive than a billion Suns. Because of this characteristic, a black hole has extreme gravity that causes everything that comes too close to be pulled in and lost forever, even light, which is the fastest thing in the universe. \n3.\tElicit discussion on what children think gravity is. Use the background information provided to explain the concept of gravity as an attractive force and that this attraction can be explained as a result of space being bent. \n4.\tCover a stretchy sheet on a large round bowl. Introduce the surface of the sheet as a small portion of space and point out that this is only space in 2 dimensions because space surrounds us everywhere in all directions.\n\n*The class can be divided in small groups. For part 1, 2 and 3 of activity, the teacher can let the groups explore on their own by following the steps in the attached worksheet. For part 4, the teacher walks through the steps for the rest of the activity, instructing, explaining and demonstrating the steps for the groups to follow.* \n\n###**Part 1: Gravity (5min)**\nThe students place a medium weight marble on the sheet and see that there is a curvature due to the marble. With the medium weight marble at the center, roll a lighter marble on the sheet so that the light marble moves toward the heavier one and circles around it. An object bends space like the marble does to the stretchy sheet, causing objects to be attracted to each other. This effect is called gravity, which is the curvature of space.\n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 1 - Gravity.gif)\n\n###**Part 2: Black holes have powerful gravity (5min)**\n1.\tSome black holes can be more massive than a billion Suns. A heavy marble represents such a black hole. The medium and light marbles from activity 1 represent other objects in space e.g. stars, planets.\n2.\tPlace the heavy marble on the sheet, and then release the other 2 marbles on the sheet. They roll towards the heavy marbles.\n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 2.gif)\n3.\tAlternatively, place the medium marble in the center of the stretchy sheet and roll the light marble. It orbits and falls towards the medium marble as a result of gravity from the medium marble. Then, roll the heavy marble as the black hole on the sheet; the medium and light marbles follow the heavy marble and fall into it.\n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 3.gif)\n4.\tBased on the observations, students should see that the heavy marble bends space more than the lighter objects. Similarly, the heavy black hole curves space the most, having the most gravity, which we can see when other objects fall into it.\n\n**Recap part 1 & 2 (4 min): **\n1.\tAs students finish, sum up what they learn from activity 1. Ask students to define gravity (They should describe it as bending of space). Point out that in space, the stars and planets do not generally collide as seen with the marbles in the activity. This is due to friction of the marbles with the fabric, but there is no such fabric and so no friction in space. Gravity holds planets and stars in orbit to each other.\n2.\tGo through the questions of activity 2 in the worksheet to explain that because black hole bends space more than other objects, therefore it pulls other objects into it. \n3.\tBecause the heavy marble is bigger than the other 2 marbles, make it clear that, in reality, black holes can be more massive than the other objects, but are often smaller in size. \n4.\tAsk students to continue with part 3, following the student worksheet. \n\n###**Part 3: How do black holes prevent objects from escaping once they have fallen in? (7 min)**\n1.\tTo escape the pull due to gravity, an object needs to move fast enough (just like a space rocket shooting away from Earth). \n2.\tTake a cardboard and bend it slightly to make a flat curve. Roll a small marble from one end of the cardboard so that it rolls to the other end and falls out. Students try to explain that because the curve is not so steep, it shows that the gravity strength is not too extreme, so the marble can move fast enough to overcome the pull and escape.\n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 4.gif)\n3.\tWhen the cardboard is bent more steeply, the curve represents the stronger gravity created by black hole. Release the small marble from the less bent side of the cardboard to roll it to the other end. The marble cannot move up the steeper end. It is like the gravity in black hole that is too extreme, so the marble cannot move fast enough to escape the pull of the gravity. <br/>\n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 5.gif)\n4.\tAs students complete the activity, go through the questions in the worksheet to explain how things cannot escape from black hole\u2019s extreme pull of gravity. Explain that light and other objects also move in space, like the small marble, and fall in black hole when they get too close. Light is the fastest thing in the Universe, and even that cannot escape from the gravity pull in black hole.\n5.\tStudents can try to give a complete definition of black hole, which is a region in space where gravity pulls so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\n###**Part 4: Scenario where the Sun is replaced by a black hole (10 min)**\n1.\tPrepare in advance an aluminum foil ball with some weights (e.g. marbles) inside. This ball should be much bigger than the heavy marble used in Activity 2 but have a similar weight. \n2.\tPresent to students the aluminum ball as the Sun and the heavy marble as a black hole with the same mass as the Sun. Students should check and confirm their weights.\n3.\tLead a discussion about what would happen if our Sun was replaced by a black hole of the same mass. Use the background information to explain that the event of the Sun becoming a black hole is not feasible. But explore the question: If a black hole with the same mass as the Sun could replace it, would the Earth get sucked in this black hole? \n4.\tTell the students that to explore this question, they need to compare the gravity created by the Sun and the black hole of the same mass that replaced it.\n5.\tAsk students to place the heavy marble and the aluminum foil ball on the stretchy sheet (separately). Focus on the area of the sheet that is very close to the ball/ marble. The students should compare the bending of the sheet for each of the two objects and conclude that the curvature created by the large ball is less steep than that created by the marble, even though they have the same mass. This means that the black hole curves space around it more than the Sun does. So gravity very close in to the center becomes more extreme when the Sun is replaced by the black hole. \n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Picture1.png)\n6.\tTell students to use the light marble from activity 1 to represent the Earth. In reality the black hole would be much smaller than the Earth, not bigger as shown by the marbles in this activity. With the black hole marble at the center (and then the aluminum ball), place the Earth marble at an area close to the marble/ball and start rolling it on the sheet. <br/>\n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 7a.gif) ![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 7b.gif)\n7.\tAsk students if there\u2019s difference in the movement of the Earth marble in the two cases. The marble orbits more times around the black hole marble than with the aluminum ball because of the smaller size of the black hole and the steeper bending of space by the mass of the black hole marble.\n8.\tExplain to students that because the mass of the \u2018black hole\u2019 marble is compressed in a smaller space, instead of spreading out as much as the large ball, the space near it is curved more dramatically when compared to the larger sphere, where the space curves more gradually (use slideshow or supplementary image to aid explanation). So if the Sun was replaced by a black hole, the gravity near it would increase extremely. And if Earth was located very close to the Sun, as it orbits around, it would get pulled into the black hole that replaced the Sun. \n9.\tTell students that luckily Earth is quite distant from the Sun (at the edge of the stretchy sheet). Ask students to compare the bending of space at the edge of the sheet, when placing the heavy marble at the center and then with the aluminum foil ball. Students should conclude that the bending of space by the large ball and the black hole marble looks the same at the edge.\n10.\tAt the edge, students roll the Earth marble with the Sun aluminum ball in the center, and then repeat with the black hole marble in the center.<br/>\n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 8a.gif) \n![](/media/activities/attach/3a07d08c-ce2d-435e-b1e3-f9ff2a80fe17/Instruction image 8b.gif)\n11.\tHelp the students to realize that the Earth marble only orbits faster and more times as it gets closer to the center near the black hole marble, where space is curved more. But it moves the same when it is far away from the marble and the ball. \n12.\tConclude that further away from black hole, the gravity acts exactly the same as that of the Sun. Thus, if Sun was replaced by a black hole of the same mass, Earth would keep orbiting the same as with the Sun and would not get sucked in (but because a black hole emits no light it would be cold and dark!). \n13.\tUse this scenario to emphasize that a black hole is not like a space vacuum cleaner that sucks everything into it, destroying everything around it. Only when things get close enough, does the gravity become extreme. So much so that beyond the event horizon matter is lost forever.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "The use of stretchy sheet and marbles are based on previous Astroedu activity \u2018Model of a black hole\u2019 (http://astroedu.iau.org/en/activities/1304/model-of-a-black-hole/).

The more mass something has, the more the space is curved, and, therefore, the more gravity there is.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**Life and death of a star **<br/>\nA star consists of many layers of gas. At the center of the star, a burning core exists, where nuclear fusion occurs and joins lighter elements together to form heavier elements. This process generates heat exerting an outward pressure, counteracting the force of gravity that pulls the gas towards the centre of the star. Stars spend most of their lives with these two forces in balance, maintaining its shape and size. You can visualize this process with a hot air balloon that needs the flame to keep the balloon inflated and floating. If the flame goes out, the balloon will collapse and fall from the sky, because there is no more hot air to keep the balloon inflated. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll stars start out fusing hydrogen into helium. Small, cool stars will stop soon after that and will not continue to fuse any other heavier elements. The very hot and more massive stars continue this fusing process to create more massive elements, not only burning hydrogen and helium but also carbon, oxygen and silicon. As the star reaches the end of its life, the nuclear fusion forms iron. Iron is a very stable element and does not easily fuse into heavier elements. Therefore, it requires much more energy to fuse than it can produce. Therefore, the iron core doesn\u2019t fuse into further elements, and the star stops producing energy. When the energy production stops, the force of gravity can finally overcome the outward push from the energy generated by the fusion. As a result, the heavy outer layers of gas of the star are unsupported and the star\u2019s core collapses, and in the resulting implosion, blowing apart the rest of the star. The explosion of a star is called supernova. All massive stars will end up this way at the end of their lives, but only the most massive of them will form a black hole. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**Black hole formation**<br/>\nA black hole is a region in space where the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. This is why a black hole is invisible. Black holes can be formed in a number of ways. Some black holes can be formed directly from very big stars, more than twenty five to hundreds times bigger than our Sun, when these stars collapse at the end of their lives. After a supernova event, the core of the massive star that is left over after the explosion is still too massive to support itself against gravity. Therefore, it continues to collapse causing all of this leftover mass to be compressed into a very small space, forming a black hole. These black holes, typically have mass 3 to 100 times the mass of the Sun, and are called stellar-mass black holes. It is thought that there are around 100 million stellar-mass black holes orbiting within our own galaxy.\n<br/>\n\nAfter their formation, stellar-mass black holes can continue to grow as they accumulate more matter from their surroundings, such as other stars, gas and other black holes. If a black hole absorbs enough material, it can even grow to be more massive than a million Suns. These extremely massive black holes are called \u201csupermassive black holes\u201d, and are the largest black holes. Supermassive black holes exist at the centres of most galaxies. One even exists at the centre of the galaxy that we live in, the Milky Way. It\u2019s believed that in the conditions of the early Universe, there were a lot of large, short-lived stars, therefore many stellar-mass black holes may have existed, which then gradually accumulated material and merged together over time, creating more massive black holes, eventually containing enough mass to be a supermassive black hole.  \n<br/>\n\nBlack holes that have a mass in between the stellar and supermassive black holes are referred to as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Theoretically, these black holes should exist but scientists have not observed any of such black holes yet; at present there is only one good candidate, called HLX-1. IMBHs can be 100 to 100,000 times more massive than our Sun. It is proposed that IMBHs may form by feeding onto a stellar mass black hole, or by the merger of many stellar-mass black holes. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory, black holes less massive than stellar-mass black holes may also exist. These are called primordial black holes or mini black holes. They are the smallest black holes. It is believed that they may have been created soon after the Big Bang, where the enormous pressures and temperatures required for the formation of such a small black hole were present. However, these mini black holes are yet to be observed. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**Where does a black hole\u2019s extreme gravity come from? **<br/>\nA black hole is much smaller in size than what would be expected from the enormous mass that it can contain. For example, primordial black holes would be the size of an atom but the mass of a large mountain. Supermassive black holes that have the diameter of our solar system but the mass more than millions Suns. When such enormous mass is compressed into a tiny space, space becomes extremely curved (like a deep well). If another object gets close enough to the concentrated mass, space becomes very curved and, therefore, gravity is extreme. In such extreme gravity, once an object falls into the well it becomes trapped. In contrast, when the same mass is larger in size, gravity isn't so extreme because the object\u2019s mass is spread out over a larger area, curving space more gradually (like a shallow pit), and the force of gravity is less extreme. Because the enormous mass of black hole is extremely concentrated, it warps space so much that everything, once entered, cannot escape from the gravitational pull or well, not even light. Black holes do not necessarily have more mass than everything else in the Universe but the compression of its mass into a small area creates its extreme gravity.\n  \n", "fulldesc": "&lt;iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pX5WH8P4IU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Instruction image 1b.JPG)\n**Figure 1: Aluminum foil balloon**\n\n2. Tell the students that the inner aluminium foil and the balloon is the core of the star. The outer aluminium foil is a layer of gas. Use the background information to explain that this gas layer is maintained on the surface, holding the star\u2019s shape, because of the burning core. This burning creates a pressure that pushes the gas outward. In this activity, the air in the balloon pushes outward, representing the pressure generated by the burning.\n3. Explain to the students that opposing this outward push is gravity. Gravity causes the gas to be pulled inwards. Students then use their hands to gently squeeze the foil-covered balloons, imitating the effect of gravity, which pulls the gas towards the centre of the star. But the balloon does not collapse. Students try to explain why this is the case; this is because of the air in the balloon pushing outward.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Instruction image 2.jpg)\n**Figure 2: Hands compressing aluminum foil balloon**\n\n4. Tell the students that throughout a star\u2019s life, the outward force generated by burning within the star balances the inward force of gravity. Therefore, the star does not collapse due to gravity when burning is occurring. Ask students to record the initial mass of this aluminum covered balloon.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Instruction image 3.JPG)\n**Figure 3: Aluminium foil balloon - Initial weight**\n\n5. Explain that at the end of the star\u2019s life, it runs out of fuel to burn in its core and burning stops. This is like popping the balloon (use a sharp pin). At this step, retain the foil in its original shape around the balloon.\n6. Relating to the balloon in the activity, students should predict what happens to the star under the effect of gravity now that burning has stopped. Since there\u2019s no longer an outward push from within to support the star, gravity now wins and the star collapses. Just like the balloon-aluminum foil can now be compressed with hands. \n7. Use the background information to explain that as a star collapses, the gas layer (outer aluminum foil) is blown away. The leftover core is still too massive, but gravity collapses it further, compressing all of the mass into a smaller and smaller area. \n8. Students remove the outer aluminum foil (it gets blown away), leaving the inner foil representing the star\u2019s core. Students then use their hands to act as gravity, pushing inward and squeezing the remaining \u2018core\u2019 aluminum foil into a smaller ball (representing a black hole). \n9. Students then measure the mass of the crumpled aluminum foil (which now represents a black hole) and compare that result with the initial mass (the star) that they recorded. They should realise that the black hole still contains a lot of mass of the star, but has lost some during the process.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Instruction image 4.JPG)\n**Figure 4:Aluminium foil balloon \u2013 weight after collapse**\n\n10. Students discuss which one is more dense, the initial star or the black hole. The black hole is smaller but it still contains a lot of the mass of the initial star, so it is more dense because the mass is concentrated in a smaller volume.\n11. Conclude the activity by discussing with the students that the collapse of the star into such a small region of space results in a black hole, with extreme gravity, where the black hole will capture anything that comes too close. To understand how gravity is so extreme in black holes, students might first need to recap what gravity is, which is outlined in the next activity. \n\n###**Part 2: Gravity (7 min)**\n1. Use the background information to explain the concept of gravity as an attractive force and that this attraction can be explained as a result of space being bent by the mass of an object.\n2. Place a stretchy sheet on a large round bowl. Introduce the surface of the sheet as a small portion of space and point out that this is only space in 2 dimensions because space surrounds us everywhere in all directions.\n3. Students then place a heavy marble on the sheet and observe there is a curvature due to the marble. Then they roll a lighter marble on the sheet so that the light marble moves toward the heavier one and circles around it. An object bends space like the marble does to the stretchy sheet, causing objects to move towards each other. This effect is called gravity, which is the curvature of space.\n\n*In space, the stars and planets do not generally collide as seen with the marbles in the activity. This is due to friction of the marbles with the fabric, but there is no such fabric in space. Gravity holds planets and stars in orbit to each other.*\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Instruction image 5.gif)\n**Figure 5: Gravity \u2013 stretchy sheet and marbles**\n\n###**Part 3: How does black hole create enormous gravity? (7 min)**\n1. As the students have understood gravity as space curvature, they now investigate how gravity in black holes is so extreme. Ask the students to recap how a black hole is created from the initial star. Answer: it is the concentration of mass into tiny space. Show the students the heavy marble as the black hole and a large ball of the same mass as the marble to represent the initial star (like in activity 1). Have the students confirm the two have similar weights. \nIf a larger ball is not available, prepare in advance an aluminum foil ball with some weights (e.g. marbles) inside to have the same weight to the black hole marble. \n2. Students place the initial star (large ball) on the stretchy sheet and compare its curvature with the curvature created when replacing it with the black hole marble. The curvature created by the large ball is less steep than that created by the black hole marble.<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Picture2.png) <br/>\n**Figure 6: Comparing curvature created objects different in density**<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Ask the students to relate this observation to explain how the black hole created from the collapse of a star has extreme gravity. Help the students (if needed) by telling them to relate the density of the objects with the space curvature it creates. Because a black hole is denser, the mass of the \u2018black hole\u2019 marble is compressed into a smaller space, instead of spreading out as much as the large sphere, it creates steeper space curvature. \n4. Confirm with students that this experiment shows how the gravity of a black hole is so extreme. The small size of a black hole allows an object to get very close to it, to an area where space is greatly curved. Therefore the object, at this point, experiences the extreme gravity of the black hole and gets pulled in. \n\n###**Part 4: Which stars can become a black hole? The evolution of a black hole (10 min)**\n1. Use the accompanying slideshow (if possible) to show students the size of the Earth compared to the Sun and that only stars that are massive enough, at least twenty five times more massive than the Sun, can become a black hole when they collapse.\n2. Use the accompanying slideshow (or printed image) and show students that there is a supermassive black hole at the centre of our Milky Way galaxy. Tell students that this black hole has a mass of more than a million suns. \n3. The students should work in groups to solve a puzzle of events to reorder the formation of black holes and evolution to supermassive black holes. Present to the students this blank flow chart. Print out a set of 8 accompanied images for each group for this activity.<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Instruction image 7.png)\n**Figure 7: Blank flow chart - Black hole formation and evolution events**\n\n4. Have the students discuss in their groups to arrange the flowchart in the correct order. Once finished, have all student groups present their arrangement on the board and explain their flowchart. If there\u2019s a difference between the groups, all groups should discuss together and give arguments to explain their work. \n5. The correct flow chart is shown below. You can provide some hints for students to help them get started (if necessary): \n- Remember that only stars, twenty five to hundreds of times more massive than our Sun, could collapse into a black hole. \n- As the star is blown apart when it collapses, it loses some mass and the leftover mass is compressed to become a black hole.<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/582d571d-db02-4f71-8c74-2e624ed5d96f/Instruction image 8.png)\n**Figure 8: Completed flow chart - Black hole formation and evolution events**\n\n6.

Everything with mass has gravity. We can feel the force of gravity as we jump up and get pulled down to the ground. Planets, stars, moons and other objects in the Universe also have gravity. That\u2019s why they orbit around each other, like for example the Earth orbits the Sun, or the Moon orbiting around the Earth, instead of flying randomly in space. That\u2019s why we see the Moon and the Sun every day. Groups of stars are held together forming galaxies and even galaxies are held together by gravity forming galaxy clusters. Thus, gravity can be seen as the universal glue.  \n<br/>\nThe more mass something has, the stronger the gravity it produces. The Earth\u2019s gravity is stronger than the Moon\u2019s because it is more massive. So our bodies are pulled down on Earth more than if we were on the Moon. That\u2019s why astronauts can jump higher and more easily on the Moon than on Earth. Our bodies also exert gravitational forces on other objects, but because our mass is so low, the gravity from our bodies does not affect objects any way we can see. The strength of gravity also changes with the distance to an object. The pull between the Earth and the Moon is stronger than that between the Earth and Jupiter. This is because the Earth is closer to the Moon than to the Jupiter. <br/>\n\nGravity was first described by Newton as a force. Described more than 300 years ago, Newton\u2019s theory of gravity is still applied today and it was used when scientists plotted the course to land man on the moon. Although Newton\u2019s theory describes the strength of gravity fairly accurately, he didn\u2019t know what caused gravity or how it worked. These concepts were left unknown for nearly 250 years, until Albert Einstein described gravity as the curvature of space. Space has 3 dimensions: up-down, left-right and forward-backward; and it can be visualized as a fabric, like a stretchy sheet. Any object with mass deforms space, just like a marble creating a dimple on the surface of the stretchy sheet. This curvature of space causes objects to interact and move towards one another, which is seen as gravity, a natural consequence of a mass\u2019s influence on space. The more mass something has, the more the space is curved, and, therefore, the more gravity there is.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**The Universe **<br/>\nThe Earth, the planet on which we live is only a relatively small planet in the Solar system and in the vast Universe. In our Solar System, there are 8 planets, including Earth, orbiting a big star called the Sun in the center. Our Solar System also includes other smaller objects, including dwarf planets, moons orbiting planets, comets, asteroids etc. Outside the Solar System, there are similar systems, called planetary systems which also consist of planets orbiting a star. Gravity holds all these stars and planets together in something we call galaxy. We live in a galaxy called the Milky Way. It is estimated that there are about 200 billion stars in it; so it is a very big place. Outside our enormous Milky Way, there are about 100 to 200 billion more galaxies like our Milky Way. These galaxies are at enormous distances from us, in fact even with the most powerful telescope we cannot see individual stars from these distant galaxies. All the stars that we can see in our night sky with the naked eye are only within our Milky Way. All galaxies, stars, planets, from matter to energy to time itself, make up what we call the Universe. All the visible things we can observe in our Universe, we call them normal matter.\n<br/>\n\nThe normal matter that we know of only makes up less than 5% of the Universe. While this seems shocking, it is not that impossible. Think about what elements comprise the Earth. Everything that we encounter every day here on Earth is made of elements like nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and heavy elements like iron and silicon. Because we see them in such abundance, we might easily conclude that the rest of the Universe must be the same as Earth, a lot of heavy elements, a bit of hydrogen and no helium. However, these elements make up only 1% of the Sun. The Sun is composed mainly of hydrogen, some helium and not much else. Many stars, gas and other objects in space that are observable also consist of the same elements as the Sun. Just as some materials commonly found on Earth are a fraction of the Sun composition, the materials that comprise the Sun and similar space objects are not necessarily representative of all the matter in the Universe. Isn\u2019t it possible that everything on Earth and in space that we know might be as well just a tiny fraction of what really exist in the Universe? Astronomers have found evidence for the existence of other components, the main components, of the Universe; they are called dark matter and dark energy.   \n<br/>\n\n**Dark matter **<br/>\nGravity allowed scientists to discover dark matter. In 1933, a Swiss astronomer, Fritz Zwicky tried to measure the total mass of a galaxy cluster by summing the mass of each individual visible galaxy in the cluster. He found out that their total mass was not enough to create the observed gravity that holds the galaxies together to form a cluster. With just the gravity created by all of their visible matter, the galaxies would not cluster easily, if at all. Thus, Zwicky concluded that there must be something invisible, inside and around the galaxies. This matter adds the extra mass to create that gravity, strong enough to form a galaxy cluster. Zwicky called the unseen mass dark matter.\n<br/>\n\nMore evidence for dark matter has emerged over time. Photographs of galaxies showed that most of their light, i.e. most of their stars, were concentrated near the center. So most of the mass of a galaxy is concentrated in its center, meaning that gravity is stronger at the center of a galaxy than in the outskirt. Therefore, it is expected that the stars near the center of the galaxy would move faster than those farther away. However, the measurements indicated that the orbital speed of stars was the same everywhere, regardless of their distance from the center. The conclusion is that there must be invisible matter that spreads throughout a galaxy, such that stars far away from the center will feel the gravitational pull of not only the central material, but all the other matter between them. The extra force of gravity from dark matter can cause them to speed up roughly to the same speed of the stars near the center.\n<br/>\n\nAlthough it\u2019s been discovered for some time, it\u2019s still unknown what dark matter really is because it is invisible and does not interact with other normal matter that we know e.g. light, magnets, electricity. Scientists have proposed various ideas about the particles that make dark matter and designed experiments to test those ideas. However, the quest to define dark matter has been a process of elimination. Experiments have only ruled out possible candidates and left a few leading hypotheses, but yet to find the exact dark matter particles. The only thing we know about dark matter is that it is what makes it possible for galaxies to exist. Dark matter makes up 25% of the entire Universe, 5 times more than the normal matter that we know.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n**Dark energy**<br/>\nSomething even more mysterious, called dark energy, makes up 70% of the Universe, besides normal matter and dark matter. Normal and dark matter generate gravity which holds things together. Dark energy is completely opposite to gravity; it causes things to fly apart. To understand dark energy, think about what happens when you toss a ball up into the air. It goes up and gradually slows down due to the pull of gravity. Eventually, the ball stops in mid-air and falls back to the ground. Now imagine a ball, once tossed up, keeps flying up further and further, instead of being attracted back down to the ground. This event seems impossible to happen, but this is the property of dark energy. \nIn the 1990s, dark energy was discovered as astronomers observed such peculiar effect in the Universe. Scientists know that Universe has continually expanded i.e. galaxies moving away from each other, since its formation, the Big Bang. They also observed that the speed of expansion has increased, which is unexpected, because like the tossed ball, the expansion should slow down as gravity pulled on all of the galaxies. Or, the Universe would stop expanding and finally collapse, if gravity won and halted the expansion. Scientists concluded that the accelerated expansion cannot be caused by dark matter and normal matter, which generate gravity for the Universe, but must be by some form of mysterious energy. As it is invisible, they called it dark energy. Remember that the Universe has always been expanding; dark energy only speeds up this expansion. By measuring how fast the Universe is expanding, which is a combined effect of dark matter pulling galaxies together and dark energy pushing them apart, astronomers can determine the proportion between dark energy and dark matter. Like dark matter, scientists have many possible explanations, but no concrete answer for the nature of dark energy. It remains one of the greatest mysteries of the Universe. If one day we understand dark energy, it will change what we already know and the way we think about the Universe.\n", "fulldesc": "###**Introduction: (11 min)**\n1.\tStart with the video \u201cThe known Universe\u201d in the accompanied slideshow.   \n2.\tTogether with students, organize the structures in the Universe in a flow chart; from the Earth out to Solar system, other stars and planets outside solar system, our Milky Way galaxy, other galaxies that may form galaxy clusters. Altogether, these structures exist in a vast Universe.  Use background information to aid this warm-up activity.\nIf not possible to use slideshow in step 1, use background information (with provided Universe image) to guide students through step 2.\n3.\tElicit a discussion if it is possible that these structures are only a tiny fraction of the Universe. Start by using the background information to impart the mindset that what we commonly see on Earth and know of in space might not be representative for everything.  \n4.\tTell students that in this activity they will play the role of astronomers to find evidence for whether or not the Universe is only comprised of everything we can see, or something else exists. Previously available knowledge about the subject and observation of something unexpected usually help solving a mystery. \n5.\tDiscuss with the students that they know stars and planets are beautifully organized into galaxies. And they are held in place because of gravity.\n\n*After the introduction activity, the class can be divided in small groups to do the activity. For part 1 and 2, students can explore on their own using the activity guide sheet. Between each part, give the students a quick introduction and explanation about the activity. For part 3, it is best that the teacher instructs, explains and guides the students through the steps.*\n\n###**Part 1: What is gravity? (7min)**\n1.\tUse the provided background information to explain the concept of gravity as an attractive force and that this attraction can be explained as a result of space being bent.\n2.\tCover a a large round bowl with a stretchy sheet . Introduce the surface of the sheet as a small portion of space and point out that this is only space in 2 dimensions but in reality space is 3 dimensions.\n3.\tPlace a heavy marble on the sheet. Ask students to observe that there is a curvature in space (the sheet) due to the mass of the marble. Then roll a lighter marble on the sheet so that the light marble moves toward the heavier one and circles around it. \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 1.gif)\n**Figure 1: Gravity \u2013 stretchy sheet + marbles**\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tExplain that an object in space has mass (like the marbles), which determines how much it weighs (heavy or light). A mass bends space just like the marble does to the stretchy sheet, causing objects to pull other objects towards each other. Point out that this effect is called gravity, which is due to the bending of space. The mass determines how much space is curved, meaning how strong its gravity is (more mass, more curve, more gravity).\n5.\tExplain that similarly, stars and planets also bend space, creating gravity, which causes them to orbit each other and, eventually, organize into groups such as galaxies and galaxy clusters (or stars and stellar clusters). The gravity of a cluster is related to the mass of everything within the cluster, all the stars, planets, galaxies and other things. Based on this knowledge, they will solve the mystery of whether an invisible matter exists in space.\n\n###**Part 2: The discovery of dark matter (15 min)**\n1.\tUse the washbowl/stretchy sheet set-up from activity 1 and place a number of marbles on the sheet. Label this as set A. Prepare, in advance, another setup (labeled set B) which is a washbowl and a stretchy sheet that has an extra heavy weight tied by a string at the middle of the sheet. Fix the sheet on the washbowl so that the extra weight is hidden and hanged underneath. Cover the dip created by the hanging extra weight by placing marbles on the sheet (total weight and number of marbles are same as set A).  \nNote: Prepare in advance separate marble bags for the two setups to bring into class.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 2.JPG)\n**Figure 2: Dark matter experiment Set A**<br/>\n<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 3a.JPG) \n<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 3b.JPG) \n<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 3c.JPG) **Figure 3: Dark matter experiment Set B**\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tTell students they are acting as astronomers who study the mass and gravity of a galaxy cluster. Set A represents what the galaxy cluster should look like in theory and set B is actual observation. Ask students to observe the 2 sets and point out the difference (set B curves the sheet more than set A). As astronomers, they need to find out if the two sets are just the same galaxy cluster (consisting same galaxies) and why there is a difference.\nYou can have several sets A and B and some groups looking at sets A while the others look at sets B. Once they finish with a set, they can go to the other set to work.\n3.\tStudents should record the total weight of all the \u2018galaxies\u2019 (marbles on the sheet) and compare the gravity (sheet curvature) of the 2 sets. As they compare the curves, they confirm that set B has more gravity than set A. And as they realize that both sets have same total mass of marbles, they should indicate that this much mass should create space curvature as seen in set A, and not set B.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 4a.JPG)\n**Figure 4: Dark matter set A**<br/>\n<br/>\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 4b.JPG) \n**Figure 4: Dark matter set B**<br/>\n<br/> \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 4c.jpg)\n**Figure 4: Dark matter experiment Set A (left) vs Set B (right)** <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tStudents should record the strange observation that a curve exists even after all the marbles have been removed in set B. Students should come to the conclusion that there must be \u201cinvisible\u201d extra mass that creates the extra gravity.  Show students the extra weight hanging underneath.\n5.\tTell students that sometimes what we observe, or the outcome of an experiment, doesn't match our prediction. Use the background information to relate this activity to how scientists discovered dark matter. They measured the total mass of galaxies in a galaxy cluster and this was not enough to create the gravity that holds the cluster. There must be extra invisible mass that creates extra gravity. They called it dark matter.\n6.\tClarify that dark matter is invisible, it cannot be seen like the extra weight. Scientists are still unsure what dark matter really is and there are still many ongoing research about this topic.\n\n###**Part 3: Dark energy (15min)**\n1.\tUse the accompanying materials (slideshow or chart) to point out scientists calculated that all the visible matter (seen in the warm-up video) contributes only 5% of the Universe. Dark matter is only 25% of the Universe. The remaining 70% is something else completely different from normal matter and dark matter. It\u2019s called dark energy and, like dark matter, also invisible.  \n2.\tTell students that dark energy was discovered from an unexpected observation, different from the facts that we already knew and what we expected. Present students \nFact 1: The Universe has continually expanded since its formation. It\u2019s like an expanding balloon.\n \n3.\tSlightly inflate a balloon with some dots drawn on it. Tell students that this is our Universe at birth, everything is compact (the dots are close together).  Continue to blow the balloon and the dots on the balloon move far away from each other. This is like our Universe, it has been expanding and the dots are like the galaxies moving apart in our expanding Universe.\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 5a.JPG) <br/> \n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/1322d2f7-f584-46db-b6d8-49094a233086/Instruction image 5b.JPG) <br/>\n**Figure 5: Dark energy experiment balloons**<br/>\n<br/>\n4.\tTell students Fact 2: Gravity of dark matter and normal matter holds everything in Universe together. Despite this effect of gravity, Universe has been expanding and galaxies fly away from each other. Tell students that in fact Universe expansion has become faster. Help students to make an analogy to this Universe acceleration with the balloon model. Students should relate the Universe expansion to an imaginary punctured balloon  that does not collapse but can expand even faster. \n5.\tAs scientists observed faster Universe expansion, this must be the effect of something else that exists in more quantity and opposes the gravity caused by the normal matter and dark matter. They called it dark energy. (Ensure that students are not confused that dark matter and dark energy are related by emphasizing their completely opposite effects).\n\n###**Part 6: Wrap up (3 min)**\n1.\tConclude that the normal matter we know is only a tiny fraction; the main components of our Universe are invisible. However, it\u2019s still not known what dark matter and dark energy really are. Scientists are still working and debating on different theories they have.  \n2.\tGo through the entire activity with the students to point out how they have worked like a scientist. Working in the field of science means there will always be unexpected results, which must be carefully recorded as they may signal for something new to be discovered. To solve the mysteries, it requires observation, deduction, make hypothesis based on observation and available knowledge, and finding proof to support one\u2019s idea. \n3.\tPoint out the fluid nature of science as our view and understanding continuously evolve with changes or updates in current knowledge, made by observations, measurements and theories.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "The use of stretchy sheet and marbles for demonstration of gravity is inspired by previous Astroedu activity \u2018Model of a black hole\u2019 (http://astroedu.iau.org/en/activities/1304/model-of-a-black-hole/).\nFor more activities about finding proofs for dark matter and to understand how much scientists currently know about what make dark matter and dark energy, continue with the second session using the Activity Part 2 - Understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy.\n", "conclusion": "In this activity, students play role of scientists to explore the possible existence of other components of the Universe besides the normal matter.

Da secoli, il cielo stellato \u00e8 di ispirazione per tutti i popoli del mondo. Le stelle non sono state protagoniste soltanto di studi scientifici, ma anche in storie popolari e arte. Gli astronomi le hanno osservate per secoli ad occhio nudo, poi in seguito con telescopi da terra e dopo ancora dallo spazio. Pian piano, hanno compreso cos\u2019\u00e8 una stella.\n\nIn arte, spesso vengono rappresentate come oggetti puntiformi o a cinque punte (o pi\u00f9). Questo perch\u00e9 la luce proveniente dalle stelle, passando attraverso l\u2019atmosfera e muovendosi tra blocchi di aria calda e fredda, appare scintillante ed assume la forma a punte. Vediamo le stelle cos\u00ec piccole perch\u00e9 sono molto lontane. \nQuando i nostri telescopi catturano la luce di queste stelle, la luce viene deviata tra le aste che sostengono gli specchi, mostrando quindi una stella a quattro punte. Qualcosa di simile accade nell\u2019occhio, a causa delle sue strutture interne. Questo non succede quando guardiamo i pianeti del sistema solare, perch\u00e9 ci appaiono pi\u00f9 grandi e a forma di disco. \nDa vicino, si vede che le stelle non hanno punte, ma sono sfere di gas molto caldo, come il Sole, che \u00e8 la stella pi\u00f9 vicina al nostro pianeta.\n\nCi sono diversi tipi di stelle. Il Sole \u00e8 una stella nana gialla. Le stelle hanno diversi colori e sono classificate come rosse, gialle e blu. Le stelle rosse sono le pi\u00f9 fredde, mentre quelle blu sono le pi\u00f9 calde, proprio come i diversi colori della fiamma sui fornelli. \nOltre le nane gialle, ci sono molti altri tipi di stelle, come le giganti rosse, o supergiganti rosse, che sono pi\u00f9 grandi e fredde. Quando le stelle come il nostro Sole restano senza combustibile (ossia quando gli atomi di idrogeno vengono convertiti in atomi di elio) la stella si espande ed entra nella fase di \u201cgigante\u201d.\n\nAbbiamo anche sentito parlare di stelle cadenti.

(Illustrare sia la risposta scientifica sia quella culturale e mostrare perch\u00e9 \u00e8 utile combinare arte e scienza.)\n* Spiegare che le stelle non sono importanti solo in scienza ma anche in ambiti culturali, come ad esempio la narrativa, la religione e l\u2019arte.\n\n###Passo 2\nDistribuire il materiale e chiedere agli studenti di disegnare una stella su un tessuto colorato. Notare che alcuni studenti potrebbero disegnare stelle con le punte, e da l\u00ec iniziare una discussione sul perch\u00e9 le stelle sembrano avere punte.\n\n###Passo 3\nMostrare ora agli studenti diverse immagini di stelle e spiegargliele brevemente.\n* Una stella nel cielo notturno\n* Il Sole\n* Gigante rossa vista da vicino\n* Illustrazione di una stella (a 5 punte, 6 punte, etc)\n\nAttenzione: MAI guardare direttamente il sole con un binocolo, un telescopio o a occhio nudo.  Ne potrebbero conseguire seri danni alla vista, compresa la cecit\u00e0. Gli astronomi e gli  osservatori del cielo esperti usano occhiali e filtri speciali per osservare il Sole in modo sicuro.\n\n###Passo 4\nDistribuire tessuti colorati e chiedere agli studenti di disegnare di nuovo una stella. Confrontarla poi con la versione precedente e discutere il cambiamento. Ora che sono consapevoli di altri modi in cui possono apparire le stelle, chiedere loro di disegnarne altre.\n\n###Passo 5\nChiedere agli studenti di ritagliare le stelle che hanno disegnato, di decorarle ed incollarle su un pezzo di cartoncino rettangolare. Questo cartoncino pu\u00f2 essere pinzato (dall'insegnante) a forma di cappello.\n\n###Passo 6\nGli studenti possono presentare i loro cappelli e descrivere i diversi tipi di stelle che hanno rappresentato.

Ai livelli della scuola elementare, il concetto di \"geografia\" (che pu\u00f2 essere considerata una parte del pi\u00f9 generale curriculum di \"Scienze\") copre i concetti base di vari campi delle Scienze della Terra e dell'Atmosfera, ad esempio geologia, geomorfologia, cartografia, meteorologia e climatologia. Noi seguiamo questo concetto.\n\n**Di cosa NON si occupa questa attivit\u00e0?**\nQuesta attivit\u00e0 non \u00e8 una pratica di interpretazione delle immagini della Planetologia, n\u00e9 un\u2019introduzione alle strutture del Sistema Solare o all\u2019Astronomia. L\u2019Astronomia \u00e8 una disciplina completamente diversa dalla Planetologia, che studia i corpi planetari. Un\u2019importante branca della Planetologia \u00e8 chiamata Astrogeologia: che studia la geologia superficiale di pianeti e satelliti. Questa \u00e8 un\u2019attivit\u00e0 Astrogeologica e Planetologica. L\u2019Astronomia riguarda invece stelle, galassie e i moti dei corpi celesti. \n\n**Problemi Cartografici**\nLa mappa mostra Plutone e Caronte nella Proiezione di Lambert (che mostra separatamente gli emisferi dei corpi ). Gli emisferi Sud di entrambi i corpi sono in ombra, perch\u00e8 lo erano quando la sonda New Horizons \u00e8 passata, quindi non \u00e8 stato possibile avere un\u2019immagine ben visibile. Gli altri lati di Plutone e Caronte non sono stati ripresi perch\u00e8 la sonda \u00e8 passata da un solo lato del sistema binario.\n\n**Astrobiologia**\nRiguardo le creature \u201caliene\u201d: sulla mappa, le immagini dei rilievi superficiali sono reali e posti nella loro vera posizione, ma le creature viventi sono completamente immaginarie. Dev\u2019essere chiarito dall\u2019insegnante che nessuna vita o segno di vita passata \u00e8 mai stato identificato su un pianeta o satellite oltre che sulla Terra, affinch\u00e9 gli studenti non pensino che su questi pianeti vivano \u201calieni\u201d. \nQuesta pu\u00f2 essere una buona opportunit\u00e0 di parlare del fatto che tra i miliardi di esopianeti esistenti nell\u2019universo, a differenza della maggior parte dei pianeti e satelliti extraterrestri del Sistema Solare, potrebbero trovarsene alcuni con condizioni favorevoli alla vita. \nUna nuova, eccitante disciplina della scienza planetaria \u00e8 l\u2019Esoplanetologia, che tratta i pianeti fuori dal Sistema Solare. Molti di questi esopianeti ed esosatelliti sono completamente diversi dai nostri. \nL\u2019obiettivo principale delle missioni spaziali \u00e8 quello di trovare la vita extraterrestre. Per questo la NASA stava cercando tracce di acqua su Marte: ora che \u00e8 stata identificata sotto forma di ghiaccio, contenuta in alcuni siti geologici, gli scienziati stanno cercando luoghi dove la vita potrebbe essersi sviluppata in passato ed essere sopravvissuta in rifugi geologici (grotte, nel sottosuolo, dentro le rocce, strati conteneti acqua, etc..). Potrebbe esserci un oceano sotterraneo esposto allo spazio in nuove fratture. \nOggi gli scienziati stanno cercando forme di vita basate sugli stessi materiali della vita terrestre, ossia carbonio e acqua. Potrebbero esistere forme di vita diverse, ma dato che non lo sappiamo e non potremmo identificarle, ci si concentra sulla ricerca di vita basata sul carbonio.\n\n**Riguardo i programmi spaziali**\nOltre alla ricerca della vita, o corpi e regioni abitabili, il programma spaziale \u00e8 motivato dalla competizione tra nazioni. \nL\u2019esplorazione spaziale aiuta anche a capire i processi geologici sul nostro pianeta, e passato e futuro della Terra. Ad esempio, l\u2019effetto serra su Venere pu\u00f2 aiutarci a predire il futuro di simili processi sul nostro pianeta, o i crateri di impatto mostrano come la Terra appariva quattro miliardi di anni fa. \nUno dei risultati pi\u00f9 inaspettati del programma Apollo 11, quando alcuni uomini sbarcarono sul satellite, \u00e8 il cosidetto \u201ceffetto della veduta di insieme\u201d: \u00e8 stata la prima - e finora l\u2019ultima - volta che occhi umani hanno visto il nostro pianeta come un \"pallido punto azzurro nello Spazio\", il ch\u00e9 ha drasticamente modificato la loro percezione del nostro mondo e del suo posto nell\u2019universo.\n\n**Riguardo le ricerche spaziali**\nAlcuni scienziati studiano una singola formazione morfologica per anni, cercando di spiegare come si \u00e8 formata, mentra altri mappano specifiche regioni in dettaglio e classificano le formazioni rilevate sulla mappa. \nQuando uno scienziato pubblica i risultati della ricerca, essi diventano un piccolo mattone nel grande edificio della Planetologia ed altri scienziati potranno usarli per migliorare i loro modelli di evoluzione superficiale, o usarli nelle loro ricerche. La maggior parte dei contenuti mostrati su queste mappe sono stati ottenuti nell\u2019ultima decade, e in alcuni casi solo negli ultimi anni. La modalit\u00e0 di formazione di alcuni rilievi superficiali ancora non \u00e8 stata del tutto capita.\n\n###Descrizione generale dei parametri che possono essere discussi caratterizzando i pianeti o i satelliti scelti\n**Tipo di corpo**: pianeta o satellite. I pianeti orbitano attorno al Sole, i satelliti attorno ai pianeti. Un lato del satellite di solito \u00e8 sempre rivolto verso il pianeta (*tidally locked*).\n\n**Composizione**: i corpi rocciosi sono fatti di rocce silicee (come la Terra). I corpi ghiacciati sono fatti da un misto di roccia e ghiaccio, ma le loro superfici sono prevalentemente ghiacciate (come Europa). Su questi pianeti montagne e pianure sono fatte di ghiaccio molto duro. Questo tipo di corpi si trova soltanto nel pi\u00f9 freddo Sistema Solare Esterno, pi\u00f9 freddo.\n\n**Atmosfera**: l\u2019atmosfera si crea solo se la gravit\u00e0 del corpo \u00e8 sufficiente a trattenere le molecole di gas: ci\u00f2 \u00e8 pi\u00f9 facile a basse temperature.\n\n**Liquidi**: i liquidi sono formati principalmente da acqua nel Sistema Solare Interno o metano, etano, azoto nel Sistema Solare Esterno. I liquidi sono presenti solo se c\u2019\u00e8 un\u2019atmosfera d\u2019aria che crea pressione. Se tale pressione \u00e8 troppo bassa, le molecole di liquido evaporano. Se la temperatura \u00e8 troppo bassa, i liquidi si solidificano, mentre se \u00e8 troppo alta evaporano. Potrebbe per\u00f2 esserci acqua nel sotterraneo.\n\n**Clima**: range di temperatura diurna e forme di precipitazioni.\n\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: caratteristiche prodotte da forze interne al pianeta. Il **vulcanismo** richiede un endoterra sciolto. Il calore \u00e8 fornito dai processi di formazione planetaria (calore di impatto/accrescimento) o dal decadimento di elementi radioattivi. Corpi pi\u00f9 piccoli si raffreddano prima di quelli pi\u00f9 grandi, quindi il vulcanismo si trova solo sui pianeti pi\u00f9 grandi, a meno che non ci sia un continuo riscaldamento interno: questo accade in satelliti su orbite ellittiche a causa delle forze di marea. I vulcani crescono aggiungendo lava, ma possono collassare e produrre bacini la cui forma ricorda quella di un cratere.\nLe **caratteristiche tettoniche** sono causate da sollecitazioni di una crosta fragile, e producono effetti durante i terremoti. Questo richiede movimenti interni al pianeta, che possono essere guidati dal riscaldamento interno.\n\n**Caratteristiche esogene**: caratteristiche prodotte da processi superficiali o atmosferici. Includono le caratteristiche eoliche, fluviali, lacustri e oceaniche e i loro depositi.\n\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: caratteristiche prodotte impattando corpi (piccoli crateri e grandi bacini d\u2019impatto). I crateri pi\u00f9 giovani hanno raggi radiali, dovuti ai materiali espulsi.\n\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: la caratteristica pi\u00f9 comune sono i crateri. La maggior parte dei crateri si sono creati poco dopo la formazione del Sistema Solare, quando c\u2019erano ancora molti piccoli corpi nello spazio. I crateri sono rari sulla superfici che si sono rimodellate recentemente, perch\u00e8 in esse i crateri sono stati rimossi o sepolti. Il processo di rimodellazione superficiale include pianure vulcaniche, erosione fluviale e sedimentazione, e subduzione delle placche tettoniche.\n\n**Caratteristiche rare**: caratteristiche che non si trovano in molti altri posti, e possono essere causate da condizioni atmosferico/climatiche molto specifiche, o resti di un evento inusuale avvenuto in passato.\n\n**Parametri limitanti per la vita**: le forme di vita dovrebbero essere in grado di crescere e riprodursi. I limiti sono dati dalle temperature di congelamento ed ebollizione dell\u2019acqua, dalle caratteristiche dell\u2019atmosfera, presenza di acqua e di una magnetosfera, che protegge i corpi dalle radiazioni dei venti solari.\n\n**Nomenclatura**: il nome del luogo pu\u00f2 essere proposto dallo scienziato che studia tale regione o formazione e approvato dal gruppo di lavoro dell\u2019Unione Astronomica Internazionale specializzato nella nomenclatura planetaria. Ad ogni tipo di formazione \u00e8 associato un tema particolare (ad esempio: Dei del Fuoco per Io) e i termini generici (come Montagne) sono in lingue latine per assicurare la neutralit\u00e0 linguistica. Ci\u00f2 segue anche la tradizione geografica del 1600 quando fu creata in Europa la prima mappa dei satelliti, con nomi latini.\n\n**Et\u00e0**: et\u00e0 della superficie. La presenza di molti crateri indica una superficie vecchia (4 miliardi di anni), mentre pochi crateri indicano una superficie pi\u00f9 giovane (0-3 miliardi di anni). Nel Primo Sistema Solare c\u2019erano molti piccoli oggetti che potevano impattare i corpi formando crateri. Col passare del tempo sono diminuiti, perch\u00e9 molti hanno impattato pianeti ed altri sono stati espulsi a causa dei campi gravitazionali.\n\n**Forme dei tratti geologici**:\n**Circolare**: solitamente l\u2019impatto di un cratere, a volte un bacino vulcanico.\n**Lineare**: frattura vulcanica nel caso di solchi; dune, creste o montagne nel caso di rilievi.\n**Sinuoso**: fiumi o canali di lava.\n**Lobato**: cratere di impatto pieno d\u2019acqua, detriti derivanti da un vulcano o un impatto, ghiacciai, frane. \n**Radiale**: raggi del cratere di impatto.\n**Concentriche**: anelli del cratere di impatto.\n\n**Confronto con la Terra**:\n(MAPPA DELLA TERRA: usare http://countrymovers.elte.hu/countrymovers.html oppure Google map)\n\n**Tipo di corpo**: pianeta.\n**Composizione del corpo**: roccioso.\n**Atmosfera**: giusta.\n**Liquido**: acqua.\n**Caratteristiche endogene**: vulcani, faglie. Le placche tettoniche sono tipiche della Terra.\n**Caratteristiche esogenie**: fiumi, laghi, dune, pianure alluvionali, delta, ghiacciai. I ghiacciai sulla Terra non sono permanenti, e solitamente non si trovano calotte ghiacciate.\n**Caratteristiche cosmogeniche**: pi\u00f9 di 100 crateri di impatto, molti sepolti o erosi dalle placche tettoniche (subduzione), o impattati in acqua senza quindi la formazione di crateri permanenti.\n**Caratteristiche comuni**: oceani, montagne, pianure, fiumi.\n**Caratteristiche rare**: ghiacciai.\n**Parametri limitanti per la vita**: dove il clima \u00e8 troppo secco (deserto) o troppo freddo (Antarctica), l\u2019acqua non \u00e8 disponibile in forma liquida. \n**Et\u00e0**: molto giovane, circa 1 miliardo di anni.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/a1052493-715f-4f57-b87f-0c19eeed6889/olympus.jpg)\nConfronto tra il monte pi\u00f9 alto sulla Terra ed il monte Olimpo su Marte", "fulldesc": "L'insegnante dispone di una mappa di Plutone e Caronte stampata in modo da essere leggibile ed accessibile agli studenti, oppure proiettata alla massima risoluzione.\n\nDa qui si pu\u00f2 scegliere uno o pi\u00f9 dei seguenti sottoargomenti progettati per un\u2019attivit\u00e0 in classe con o senza opuscolo, o su pu\u00f2 seguire le indicazioni dell\u2019opuscolo cos\u00ec com'\u00e8.\n\nLeggere la Pagina 1 dell'opuscolo con gli studenti, chiedendo loro di sottolineare le parole che non capiscono, cos\u00ec che gliele si possano spiegare.\n\n###Cartografia\nMostrare la mappa agli studenti e chiedere loro perch\u00e9 la rappresentazione del corpo \u00e8 circolare (il pianeta \u00e8 un corpo sferico).

Nominare almeno uno dei tipi di formazione geologica (Vedere Attivit\u00e0 2 sull'opuscolo per una lista).\nIdentificare/trovare le formazioni endogene che sono state prodotte dal magma che si trova sotto la superficie (formazioni vulcaniche: vulcani, flussi di lava. formazioni tettoniche: crepe, fratture). \nIdentificare/trovare le formazioni esogene prodotte da processi che operano sulla superficie in un pianeta con atmosfera (vento: dune, deserti. acqua: agenti atmosferici, oceani, laghi, sedimenti). \nIdentificare/trovare formazioni cosmogeniche prodotte da processi di impatto (crateri o bacini di impatto creati da asteroidi o comete provenienti dallo spazio).\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 2**: Realizzare una mappa semplificata, basandosi su quella vera, evidenziando solo i contorni delle formazioni pi\u00f9 grandi e importanti (disegnare diversi tipi di formazioni, ad esempio crepe e crateri). Si possono disegnare a matita o a colori. Cercare di includere:\n\n**Per Plutone (cerchio a sinistra)**:\n- Glaciazioni: pianure di azoto ghiacciato a forma di cuore (Sputnik Planitia) con terreno cellulare e picchi ghiacciati.\n- Calotte rosso scuro a sud.\n- Crateri d\u2019impatto.\n- Crepe tettoniche.\n\n**Per Caronte (cerchio a destra)**:\n- Tettonica: profonde voragini equatoriali.\n- Cosmogenica: punti rossi al Polo Nord (materiale rosso proveniente da Plutone).\n- Impatto: alcuni crateri con raggi, crateri senza raggi ovunque.\n\n###Esplorazione\nChiedere agli studenti dove sbarcherebbero o costruirebbero un insediamento per l\u2019esplorazione dei pianeti. Quale regione o formazione sarebbe pi\u00f9 interessante da esplorare? Perch\u00e8? Cosa vorrebbero approfondire? Quali strumenti e metodi userebbero per condurre tale esplorazione? Cosa porterebbero con s\u00e9 per eseguire tale ricerca?\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 3**: Dove sbarcheresti? Quale posto ti piacerebbe esplorare? Trova il tuo sito di sbarco e segnalo con un simbolo, dagli un nome e scrivilo accanto al simbolo.\n\n###Toponomastica\nChiedere agli studenti di leggere ad alta voce un nome dalla mappa. Chiedere loro cosa ne deducono, cosa gli suggerisce tale nome. I nomi sono in Latino perch\u00e9 i pianeti non fanno parte di alcuna nazione, ed il Latino \u00e8 considerato una lingua neutrale a livello internazionale. Chiedere agli studenti se questo nome neutrale gli piace o se preferirebbero un nome in Italiano o Inglese. Si possono spiegare i significati dei nomi sulla mappa. I corrispondenti nomi in Inglese si possono trovare sul sito http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/DescriptorTerms. \n\n**Attivit\u00e0 4**: Una volta terminata la parte grafica, creare una nomenclatura: scrivere i nomi delle formazioni geologiche che sono state disegnate accanto ad esse. Scrivere tre nomi sulla mappa. Si possono usare colori o lettere diversi per ogni genere di formazione (ad esempio lettere maiuscolo per i continenti, lettere rosse per i canali di lava etc.). L\u2019importante \u00e8 restare coerenti.\n\n###Astronomia, Climatologia, Meteorologia\nChiedere agli studenti se c\u2019\u00e8 atmosfera su questi pianeti e perch\u00e9 lo pensano. \nTrovare dati sul il clima (temperatura massima e minima sulla superficie) sul pannello di controllo della mappa o sull'opuscolo. Non confondere i valori delle coordinate mostrate sulla mappa ( 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0...) con i valori delle temperature sul pannello di controllo. \nChiedere agli studenti se sul pianeta ci sono acqua o altri materiali allo stato liquido, e come fanno a saperlo. Confrontare il range di temperatura locale con i punti di ebollizione e solidificazione dell\u2019acqua. Qual \u00e8 la probabilit\u00e0 di trovare acqua liquida?\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 5**: Previsioni meteo per domani, basate sulle informazioni climatiche sull'opuscolo. \nScegliere almeno tre posti e mostrare i dati meteo. Mostrare le temperature massima e minima nella vostra unit\u00e0 di misura (C o F). Considerare il fatto che pi\u00f9 si va verso i poli, pi\u00f9 \u00e8 freddo. Accanto ai numeri, mostrare il clima con un simbolo grafico disegnato da voi: soleggiato, nuvoloso, piovoso, nebbioso o altri fenomeni meteorologici interessanti che trovate sull'opuscolo. Trovare i dati sulle temperature massime e minime sul banco di controllo della mappa e informazioni ulteriori. \n\nChiedere agli studenti di che tipo di protezioni avrebbero bisogno se esplorassero la superficie fuori dal veicolo, basandosi sui valori precedentemente discussi. Ad esempio, potrebbero aver bisogno di bombole di ossigeno, una tuta che mantenga la temperatura e la pressione ottimale, etc.\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 6**: Disegnare una bandiera (per Plutone, Caronte o per entrambi), e disegnarla sulla mappa, basandosi sulle caratteristiche del corpo (clima, colore, geologia, ecc). \n\nChiedere agli studenti di stabilire se delle forme di vita, piante o animali, potrebbero sopravvivere su Plutone e Caronte, basandosi  sui valori mostrati sul pannello di controllo (temperatura e pressione - usare il concetto di acqua liquida. Abitabilit\u00e0: se pu\u00f2 esistere acqua liquida, allora la vita potrebbe esistere). \nSpiegare che nessuna forma di vita presente o tracce di forme di vita passate sono mai state trovate in altri pianeti o satelliti del Sistema Solare, n\u00e9 in esopianeti esterni, ma esistono comunque milioni di pianeti che non abbiamo mai esplorato. \nChe tipo di creature potrebbero esserci? Quali protezioni/abilit\u00e0 servirebbero loro per sopravvivere? Che aspetto avrebbero? (es. spessa pelliccia, o animali che vivono nel sottosuolo). Cosa mangerebbero? Come comunicherebbero tra loro? (n.b. senza l\u2019aria, il suono non pu\u00f2 propagarsi).\n\n###Didascalie\n**Attivit\u00e0 7**: Creare una didascalia in cui i simboli inventati da voi vengono spiegati. Potreste raggrupparli per tipo di processo (es. esogeno (atmosferico, eolico), endogeno (vulcanico, tettonico) e di impatto). Scrivere il titolo \u201cLEGENDA\u201d, spiegare i simboli e indicare a quale formazione si riferiscono.\n\nCompito per casa: chiedere agli studenti di comporre o disegnare storie usando i paesaggi della mappa come ambientazione, e le creature come personaggi. Possibile trama: come ha fatto la superficie a diventare cos\u00ec com\u2019\u00e8 adesso? (con una storia, non scientificamente).

Questi includono otto pianeti e vari corpi secondari: pianeti nani e piccoli oggetti che orbitano direttamente intorno al Sole, i satelliti (lune) che orbitano intorno a molti pianeti, e oggetti pi\u00f9 piccoli. Esso si \u00e8 formato 4,6 miliardi di anni fa dal collasso gravitazionale di una gigantesca nube molecolare. La stragrande maggioranza della massa del sistema \u00e8 nel Sole, mentre la maggior parte della rimanente si trova in Giove. I quattro pianeti interni pi\u00f9 piccoli, Mercurio, Venere, Terra e Marte, chiamati anche i pianeti terrestri, sono principalmente composti da roccia e metalli. I quattro pianeti esterni, chiamati i giganti gassosi, sono molto pi\u00f9 grandi di quelli terrestri. I due pianeti pi\u00f9 grandi, Giove e Saturno, sono composti principalmente da idrogeno ed elio, mentre i due pi\u00f9 esterni, Urano e Nettuno, sono composti principalmente da sostanze con punti di fusione relativamente alti (rispetto ad idrogeno ed elio) chiamati ghiacci, come acqua, ammoniaca e metano, e sono quindi spesso classificati separatamente come \u2018giganti ghiacciati\u2019. Tutti i pianeti hanno orbite quasi circolari che individuano un disco quasi piatto chiamato piano dell\u2019eclittica.\n\nIl termine \u201csistema solare\u201d indica una stella e tutti gli oggetti che vi orbitano attorno. Il nostro Sistema Solare consiste nel Sole (la nostra stella), otto pianeti ed i loro satelliti naturali (come la nostra Luna), pianeti nani, asteroidi e comete. Il nostro Sistema Solare \u00e8 collocato su un braccio esterno della spirale della nostra galassia, la Via Lattea.\n\n**Astro-fotografia con CCD**:\n\nUn Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) \u00e8 uno strumento elettronico per rilevare la luce. Nel caso di immagini astronomiche, questa luce \u00e8 molto tenue, e questo ha delle ripercussioni su come il sensore opera. Un CCD utilizza un sottile wafer di silicio (chip), suddiviso in migliaia o milioni di minuscoli quadrati (o a volte rettangoli) sensibili alla luce, detti fotositi. Ad ogni fotosito corrisponde un singolo pixel nell\u2019immagine finale, e quindi spesso vengono chiamati con lo stesso nome. Per maggior chiarezza in questa discussione, chiameremo \u2018fotositi\u2019 quelli su un chip CCD e pixel quelli di un\u2019immagine. Ogni fotosito \u00e8 circondato da una barriera non-conduttiva, che trattiene la carica raccolta durante un\u2019esposizione.\n\n**Parallasse**:\n\nQuello della parallasse \u00e8 un metodo di misura della distanza di un oggetto. La posizione di un oggetto appare diversa da due punti di osservazione separati. Se la distanza tra i punti di osservazione \u00e8 nota ed \u00e8 possibile misurare l\u2019angolo tra essi allora, con l\u2019aiuto di geometria elementare, \u00e8 possibile calcolare la distanza dell\u2019oggetto (in modo simile a come la nostra visione binoculare ci permette di vedere in 3 dimensioni). Nella pratica, dato che nella maggior parte delle applicazioni astronomiche l\u2019angolo di parallasse \u00e8 molto ridotto, l\u2019unico modo di sfruttare questa tecnica \u00e8 scegliere due punti di osservazione molto distanti tra loro.\n\n**Effetto di Parallasse diurna**:\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/f7cdcad1-ea62-4325-b638-773e9663c28f/diurnal_fig1.png)\n**Figura 1**. Geometria dell\u2019effetto di parallasse diurna. Dato che la Terra ruota, ciascun osservatore sulla sua superficie vede l\u2019angolo \u03c6 di parallasse dell\u2019oggetto studiato variare costantemente, da un valore massimo quando il suo meridiano si trova ad angolo retto con il piano che include l\u2019asse di rotazione della Terra e l\u2019oggetto (circa 6 ore prima o dopo il tempo di transito) ad un valore nullo ogni volta che l\u2019oggetto si trova sul suo meridiano (culmina).\n\nOgni osservatore sulla superficie terrestre si muove in realt\u00e0 lungo un percorso perfettamente circolare del raggio di diverse migliaia di kilometri, compiendo un giro intero ogni circa 23,93 ore - un giorno sidereo. In ogni dato momento, l\u2019osservatore guarda la volta celeste da prospettiva leggermente diversa ed in continuo cambiamento rispetto ad un osservatore fittizio posizionato a riposo nel centro della Terra. Questo scostamento variabile apparente degli oggetti celesti relativamente vicini rispetto a distanti \u201cstelle fisse\u201d osservato da Terra e dovuto esclusivamente alla sua quotidiana rotazione \u00e8 noto come effetto di parallasse diurna. Questo effetto si manifesta come una oscillazione angolare appena percettibile, che varia da poche centinaia di arcosecondi per oggetti sufficientemente vicini alla terra (Near-Earth Objects o NEOs), fino ad appena qualche decina di arcosecondi per gli oggetti del SIstema Solare pi\u00f9 distanti che si possano osservare. L\u2019effetto di parallasse diurna \u00e8 talmente ridotto per gli oggetti al di fuori del Sistema Solare da non essere misurabile.\n\nL\u2019effetto di parallasse diurna non ha niente a che fare con il fatto che ogni oggetto del Sistema Solare \u00e8 in movimento rispetto al centro della terra. Facendo un paragone, il movimento apparente nel cielo di ciascun corpo del sistema solare dovuto alla sua rivoluzione attorno al Sole \u00e8 di ordini di grandezza maggiore del suo corrispondente effetto di parallasse diurna. I minuscoli e oscillanti spostamenti degli oggetti vicini rispetto alle cosiddette \u201cstelle fisse\u201d caratteristici della parallasse diurna saranno quindi sempre sovrapposti a movimenti molto pi\u00f9 ampi di \u201cmoto proprio\u201d nel cielo. Pertanto, il primo passo nel calcolo della parallasse diurna consiste nel sottrarre accuratamente la traiettoria orbitale dominante attraverso il cielo dal movimento apparente effettivamente osservato del bersaglio prescelto. Se questo passaggio \u00e8 eseguito con cura e nel modo corretto, quello che rimane dopo questo filtraggio - I cosiddetti \u201cresidui\u201d - sono dovuti solo all\u2019effetto di parallasse diurna.\n\nSupponendo che per un periodo di tempo di soli due giorni la distanza dal centro della terra al bersaglio sia praticamente costante (una supposizione generalmente appropriata, tranne che per gli asteroidi vicini di tipo NEO e per la Luna) la variabilit\u00e0 nel tempo dell\u2019angolo di parallasse pu\u00f2 essere attribuita esclusivamente alla posizione variabile dell\u2019osservatore rispetto ad una direzione fissata nel piano equatoriale. In altre parole, l\u2019angolo di parallasse rimane sostanzialmente invariato rispetto al piano che contiene l\u2019asse di rotazione della Terra (ovvero in declinazione). Questo \u00e8 il motivo per cui la parallasse diurna \u00e8 anche chiamata parallasse est-ovest.\n\nL\u2019effetto di parallasse diurna corrisponde esattamente alla proiezione angolo di parallasse - quello che in ogni dato momento ha per vertice il bersaglio e per direttrici le direzioni che lo congiungono all\u2019osservatore e al centro della Terra - sul piano equatoriale. \u00c8 evidente che al momento della culminazione del bersaglio (quando l\u2019oggetto si trova sul meridiano dell\u2019osservatore), l\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna diventa nullo, mentre raggiunge il suo massimo valore teorico circa 5,98 ore (un quarto di giorno sidereo) sia prima che dopo il transito (il valore sarebbe esatto se l\u2019oggetto non si stesse muovendo rispetto al centro della Terra).\n\nPertanto, per definizione, ad ogni dato tempo t l\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna diventa\n\n\u03c6(t) = [RAtopo(t) \u2212 RAgeo(t)] cos \u03b4(t) (1)\n\ndove RAtopo(t) \u00e8 l\u2019ascensione retta topocentrica (misurata dalla posizione dell\u2019osservatore) al momento considerato, RAgeo(t) \u00e8 l\u2019ascensione retta geocentrica (misurata dal centro della Terra) nello stesso momento e \u03b4(t) \u00e8 la declinazione dell\u2019oggetto sempre nello stesso momento (che assumiamo essere praticamente la stessa sia misurata dalla posizione dell\u2019osservatore che dal centro della Terra).\n\nPer le osservazioni eseguite prima del transito, l\u2019effetto di parallasse del bersaglio rispetto alle stelle sullo sfondo fa apparire l\u2019oggetto spostato verso est rispetto a quanto verrebbe osservato nello stesso momento dal centro della Terra; ovvero, prima del transito: RAtopo(t) > RAgeo(t). Al contrario, l\u2019oggetto appare spostato verso ovest nelle osservazioni effettuate dopo il transito; ovvero, dopo il transito RAtopo(t) < RAgeo(t). Pertanto, durante la rotazione della Terra, il termine RAtopo(t) - RAgeo(t) tra parentesi varia in modo continuo man mano che l\u2019osservatore viene trascinato dalla rotazione della Terra, rendendo l\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna \u03c6(t) positivo per le osservazioni effettuate prima del transito, nullo al transito e negativo per le osservazioni effettuate dopo il transito. I massimi angoli di parallasse diurna sono in teoria raggiunti ogni volta che l\u2019osservatore e il bersaglio si trovano ad angolo retto rispetto al centro della Terra.\n\nContemporaneamente, considerando che la declinazione del bersaglio varia gradualmente col tempo, ma in maniera completamente indipendente dalla rotazione della Terra, il termine cos\u03b4(t) varia solo leggermente nell\u2019arco di qualche giorno. Pertanto, la parallasse diurna varia in sostanza su base quotidiana come una funzione sinusoidale, che in ogni istante corrisponde a RAtopo(t) - RAgeo(t) moltiplicata per il coseno quasi costante della declinazione del bersaglio, diventando quindi:\n\n\u03c6 (t) = [RAtopo(t) \u2212 RAgeo(t)] cos \u03b4(t) = \u03c6max sin(\u03c9(T0 \u2013 t)) (2)\n\ndove \u03c6max \u00e8 la massima ampiezza dell\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna per il giorno considerato, \u03c9 \u00e8 la velocit\u00e0 angolare di rotazione siderea della Terra e T0 \u00e8 l\u2019istante della culminazione del bersaglio per il giorno considerato. Una volta nota \u03c6max, la distanza D del bersaglio pu\u00f2 essere prontamente ottenuta utilizzando l\u2019approssimazione per piccoli angoli, ottenendo:\n\nD = RE cos \u03bb / \u03c6max (3)\n\ndove RE \u00e8 il raggio terrestre e \u03bb \u00e8 la latitudine dell\u2019osservatore (D e RE devono essere espressi nelle stesse unit\u00e0, mentre \u03c6max deve essere in radianti)\n\nIl metodo amatoriale a 4 punti per la misura della parallasse diurna \u00e8 una semplice procedura per determinare il valore principale di \u03c6max da una singola posizione, senza richiedere altri dati oltre a quelli strettamente legati all\u2019osservazione diretta. Utilizzando solamente un telescopio amatoriale ed un CCD in due notti consecutive, acquisendo immagini in modo continuo per dieci minuti due volte ciascuna notte - all\u2019inizio e alla culminazione - \u00e8 possibile determinare accuratamente \u03c6max, ed usarlo per calcolare la distanza dall\u2019oggetto in questione.\n\nI quattro dati richiesti sono l\u2019ascensione retta topocentrica dell\u2019oggetto misurata in due notti consecutive, ed i tempi corrispondenti. Durante la prima notte, essa dovrebbe essere misurata in un istante qualunque il pi\u00f9 lontano possibile dal transito (RAtopo(t1)) e all\u2019istante esatto del transito (RAtopo(T01)). Un\u2019analoga procedura dovrebbe essere seguita durante la seconda notte, misurando RAtopo(t2) e RAtopo(T02). Non \u00e8 necessario che le misure prese lontano dal transito ogni notte siano ugualmente distanti da esso. Pertanto, i quattro dati richiesti sono in realt\u00e0 le seguenti quattro coppie:  Per la prima notte RAtopo(t1) ed il t1 corrispondente, e RAtopo (T01) ed il T01 corrispondente. Per la seconda notte RAtopo(t2) ed il t2 corrispondente e RAtopo (T02) ed il T02 corrispondente.\n\nDato che, al momento del transito, l\u2019ascensione retta topocentrica e geocentrica sono esattamente le stesse, \u00e8 possibile ottenere un\u2019approssimazione lineare per stimare il valore altrimenti sconosciuto di RAgeo(t) in qualunque altro istante:\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/f7cdcad1-ea62-4325-b638-773e9663c28f/equautiontp.png) \t\t\t                     \n(4)\n\nQuesta approssimazione lineare per RAgeo(t) aiuta a determinare gli angoli di parallasse diurna \u03c6(t1) e \u03c6(t2) misurati agli istanti t1 e t2 lontani dai transiti ciascuna notte. Durante ciascuna notte, la variazione dell\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna pu\u00f2 essere rappresentato da una curva sinusoidale che, oltre a diventare nullo al tempo di transito, passa attraverso il punto \u03c6(t) misurato. Tali curve sinusoidali sono uniche; pertanto una volta trovate queste curve, si ricava l\u2019ampiezza massima dell\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna per quel giorno (rispettivamente \u03c6max1 e \u03c6max2). considerando che sia \u03c6max1 che \u03c6max2 sono ottenuti con una approssimazione lineare che necessariamente sottostima uno e sovrastima l\u2019altro (una fortunata combinazione illustrata in dettaglio negli articoli forniti in appendice), si pu\u00f2 ottenere una stima accurata di \u03c6max dalla loro media:\n\n\u03c6max(\u03c6max1 + \u03c6max2) (5)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/f7cdcad1-ea62-4325-b638-773e9663c28f/Fig2%20Opposition.png)\n**Figura 2**: Opposizione - Il moto apparente in ascensione retta di un pianeta minore.

Oggetti adeguati sono gli asteroidi della fascia principale che si trovino abbastanza vicini all\u2019opposizione al tempo delle osservazioni, apparendo relativamente in alto nella volta celeste orientale locale al crepuscolo. Tra questi candidati appropriati, i pi\u00f9 luminosi saranno i pi\u00f9 adatti.\n\n###Passo 2: Acquisire le immagini richieste la prima notte\n\nPer migliorare l\u2019accuratezza, nella pratica i quattro dati richiesti verranno ricavati non da quattro osservazioni isolate, ma piuttosto da quattro set di immagini: due la prima notte e altri due la seconda. Per ciascuna notte, il primo set verr\u00e0 acquisito poco dopo che il cielo sia diventato abbastanza buio, mentre il secondo set verr\u00e0 acquisito in prossimit\u00e0 del tempo di transito del bersaglio.\n\nGli studenti dovrebbero aver debitamente predisposto telescopio e sistema di acquisizione almeno quindici minuti prima del crepuscolo. Per il telescopio, questo implica allinearlo polarmente, individuarne accuratamente la direzione di puntamento e assicurarsi del normale funzionamento del sistema di inseguimento. Per quanto riguarda il sistema di acquisizione, gli studenti dovrebbero assicurarsi che la fotocamera a CCD sia correttamente connessa al controllo hardware, che abbia raggiunto e si sia stabilizzata sulla sua temperatura di esercizio, che il software di acquisizione stia funzionando a dovere, e che la destinazione ed il nome delle immagini da acquisire siano stati definiti. Per bersagli pi\u00f9 luminosi di magnitudine 14, di cui si acquisiscano le immagini con un telescopio da 20 cm con un adeguato sistema di inseguimento, i tempi di esposizione dovrebbero non superare i 30 secondi, e pertanto non dovrebbe essere necessario un sistema di autoguida.\n\nIl passo successivo sar\u00e0 quello di ottenere una misura accurata del tempo. Il metodo pi\u00f9 semplice consiste nel sincronizzare l\u2019orologio interno del PC utilizzato con un opportuno servizio internet.\n\nIl primo compito da svolgere appena le prime stelle pi\u00f9 luminose compariranno in cielo sar\u00e0 quello di mettere a fuoco la fotocamera. Una maschera di Bahtinov aiuter\u00e0 a far ci\u00f2 in modo semplice e diretto.\n\nDopo aver messo a fuoco la fotocamera con successo, il passo successivo sar\u00e0 puntare il telescopio verso il bersaglio e centrarlo nel CCD. La maniera pi\u00f9 semplice di fare ci\u00f2 \u00e8 tramite un sistema di puntamento accurato, ordinando semplicemente al telescopio di muoversi verso le coordinate equatoriali del bersaglio.\n\nL\u2019asteroide in esame dovr\u00e0 essere correttamente inquadrato dal CCD. La maniera pi\u00f9 semplice di fare ci\u00f2 consiste nel prendere un\u2019immagine e inviarla immediatamente ad uno strumento software che ne rilevi automaticamente la sua posizione astrometrica ed il suo valore fotometrico. La prima contribuir\u00e0 a confermare che le immagini abbiano inquadrato il bersaglio, il secondo ad assicurare che il tempo di esposizione selezionato aiuti a conseguire un adeguato rapporto segnale/rumore (per gli scopi dell\u2019attivit\u00e0, un SNR di almeno 20 sar\u00e0 sufficiente).\n\nUna volta verificati i requisiti per l\u2019acquisizione sar\u00e0 il momento di acquisire in modo continuo immagini dell\u2019asteroide bersaglio per circa 10-12 minuti. Non ci sono vincoli sul momento esatto in cui questo set di immagini debba essere effettivamente preso, anche se preferibilmente dovrebbe essere il pi\u00f9 lontano possibile dal tempo di transito. Questo sar\u00e0 il set di immagini da cui il primo dato dei \u201c4 punti\u201d richiesti verr\u00e0 ottenuto dopo l\u2019elaborazione. Una volta preso il primo set di immagini, non sar\u00e0 necessario fare altro fino a 30 minuti prima del tempo di transito.\n\nCirca 30 minuti prima del tempo di transito del bersaglio (ovvero quando la sua ascensione retta coincide esattamente con il tempo sidereo locale) sar\u00e0 tempo di prepararsi nuovamente per il secondo set di di immagini. La lista dei passaggi necessari \u00e8 identica alla precedente. \n\nUna volta verificati i requisiti per l\u2019acquisizione sar\u00e0 il momento di acquisire in modo continuo immagini dell\u2019asteroide bersaglio per circa 10-12 minuti vicino al tempo di transito. Al contrario del primo set, questo intervallo di acquisizione deve coincidere con il tempo di transito, ovvero \u00e8 imperativo che alcune delle immagini debbano essere prese prima del tempo di transito ed altre dopo. Questo \u00e8 il set di immagini da cui verr\u00e0 ricavato il secondo dei \u201c4 punti\u201d dopo l\u2019elaborazione. Una volta preso questo set di immagini, questa parte \u00e8 conclusa.\n\n###Passo 3: Acquisire le immagini richieste la seconda notte\n\nNella notte successiva \u00e8 necessario compiere le stesse attivit\u00e0 della notte prima. Devono essere acquisite continuamente immagini dell\u2019asteroide bersaglio per circa 10-12 minuti il pi\u00f9 lontano possibile dal tempo di transito, e per altri 10-12 minuti intorno al tempo di transito. Questi set di immagini saranno le fonti per il terzo e quarto dei \u201cpunti dati\u201d richiesti.\n\n###Passo 4: Elaborazione delle immagini ed acquisizione dei dati richiesti\n\nGli studenti dovranno elaborare le immagini acquisite compiendo tramite una corretta astrometria e riduzione dei dati. Utilizzando un software di astrometria adeguato sar\u00e0 possibile ottenere l\u2019ascensione retta topocentrica del bersaglio in ciascuna immagine acquisita. Una volta scartati valori errati sospetti, i quattro punti dati possono essere determinati mediando i valori di ascensione retta topocentrica corrispondenti a ciascun set di immagini.\n\nUna volta ottenuti i quattro valori di ascensione retta topocentrica, tutto quel che rimane \u00e8 determinare il tempo esatto corrispondente a ciascun valore ottenuto.\n\nI tempi t1 e t2 corrispondenti ai valori delle ascensioni rette topocentriche derivate dai due set lontano dal transito non sono critici; essi possono essere ottenuti semplicemente mediando i tempi delle immagini corrispondenti. I due tempi di transito T01 e T02 tuttavia sono critici - una differenza anche di pochi secondi conta - pertanto essi devono essere determinati accuratamente tramite uno studio accurato dei dati acquisiti vicini al transito in ciascuna notte.\n\nIl modo pi\u00f9 semplice di trovare l\u2019esatto tempo di transito per ciascuna notte \u00e8 utilizzare un foglio di calcolo. Le righe conterranno i dati corrispondenti a ciascuna immagine vicino al transito, mentre l\u2019intestazione delle colonne consisteranno in (1) il valore ottenuto per l\u2019ascensione retta topocentrica del bersaglio, (2) il tempo associato all\u2019immagine, (3) il corrispondente tempo sidereo locale (espresso nelle stesse unit\u00e0 dei valori delle ascensioni rette topocentriche). Inoltre, in una quarta colonna, il tempo sidereo locale verr\u00e0 sottratto al valore dell\u2019ascensione retta topocentrica del bersaglio. Infine, il tempo esatto di transito verr\u00e0 calcolato utilizzando la funzione di intercetta applicata ai dati nelle colonne (2) e (4).\n\n###Passo 5: Elaborazione dei dati\n\n Una volta noti i quattro punti dati [RAtopo(t1), t1], [RAtopo(T01), T01], [RAtopo(t2), t2], [RAtopo(T02), T02], \u00e8 necessario solamente applicare le equazioni del metodo amatoriale a 4 punti dati per il calcolo della parallasse diurna.\n\nDall\u2019equazione (4), si ricava l\u2019approssimazione lineare per trovare RAgeo in qualsiasi momento, e quindi dall\u2019equazione (1) \u00e8 possibile trovare l\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna \u03c6 ai tempi t1 e t2. Una volta noto \u03c6(t1), dall\u2019equazione (2) \u00e8 semplice ottenere l\u2019ampiezza massima dell\u2019angolo di parallasse diurna per la prima notte (\u03c6max1), con l\u2019ausilio di\n\n\u03c6 (t1) = \u03c6max1 sin(\u03c9(T01 \u2013 t1))\n\nSimilmente, l\u2019ampiezza massima dell\u2019 angolo di parallasse diurna per la seconda notte (\u03c6max2) pu\u00f2 essere calcolata da\n\n\u03c6 (t2) = \u03c6max2 sin(\u03c9(T02 \u2013 t2))\n\nInfine dall\u2019equazione (5) \u00e8 possibile ricavare il valore chiave \u03c6max, in modo da determinare tramite l\u2019equazione (3) la distanza dall\u2019asteroide.\n\n###Passo 6: Verificare la qualit\u00e0 delle distanze ricavate\n\nGli studenti dovranno confrontare i loro risultati con i valori pubblicati. L\u2019analisi delle possibili sorgenti di errore e della loro importanza relativa dovrebbe essere discussa criticamente.\n\n###Passo 7: Stesura di un report\n\nL\u2019attivit\u00e0 dovrebbe concludersi con la stesura di una sintetica relazione scientifica sulla distanza dall\u2019asteroide determinata e sul suo confronto con la distanza effettiva, oltre ad una discussione critica sulle potenziali fonti della discrepanza trovata (e sui pesi relativi corrispondenti) e sui modi per minimizzarle in misure successive.\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "Due articoli pubblicati:\nDiurnal Parallax Determinations of Asteroid Distances Using Only Backyard Observations from a Single Station http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SASS...31...45A\nThe 4-Point Backyard Diurnal Parallax Method Tested on a Challenging Far Away Target: Dwarf Planet 134340 Pluto http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013SASS...32...25A\nDue presentazioni:\n\n(in inglese): Diurnal Parallax Determinations of Asteroid Distances Using Only Backyard Observations from a Single Station http://www.olasu.com.uy/contenidos.php?action=detalle&amp;idmenu=12&amp;idcontenido=117\n\n(in spagnolo): Nuevo y Simple M\u00e9todo para la Medici\u00f3n del Paralaje Diario de Cuerpos Menores del Sistema Solar, requiriendo solo cuatro datos a partir de im\u00e1genes obtenidas desde un \u00fanico lugar http://www.olasu.com.uy/contenidos.php?action=detalle&amp;idmenu=12&amp;idcontenido=116\n\nSito dell\u2019autore: http://www.olasu.com.uy", "conclusion": "Questa attivit\u00e0 permetter\u00e0 agli studenti di misurare in autonomia l\u2019angolo di parallasse di un asteroide scelto e la sua distanza con un\u2019accuratezza del 5% in sole due notti, utilizzando modesti strumenti amatoriali.

Ognuna delle sette stelle principali di questa costellazione, che compongono le spalle, cintura e piedi dell\u2019omonimo cacciatore, sono da qualche migliaio fino ad alcune centinaia di migliaia di volte pi\u00f9 luminose del Sole.

Tranne scarse eccezioni all\u2019interno del sistema solare, non possiamo raggiungere gli oggetti del nostro studio. Dobbiamo invece dedurre le propriet\u00e0 di stelle, nebulose e pianeti dalle nostre osservazioni. Conoscere la distanza di un oggetto \u00e8 fondamentale per questo lavoro da detective cosmici. Se conoscessimo solamente la luminosit\u00e0 apparente di un oggetto nel cielo, non saremmo in grado di distinguere tra oggetti non molto luminosi ma abbastanza vicini e quelli che invece sono molto lontani ma emettono tantissima luce!\nQuesto \u00e8 evidente quando consideriamo alcuni dei pi\u00f9 elementari oggetti celesti: le stelle. La nostra esperienza diretta in una notte serena \u00e8 quella che le stelle siano piccoli puntini luminosi. Una banale torcia ci fornisce un\u2019illuminazione maggiore di tutte le migliaia di stelle che vediamo in una notte stellata messe assieme. Ma anche il Sole \u00e8 una stella, ed \u00e8 l\u2019oggetto pi\u00f9 luminoso che la maggior parte di noi avr\u00e0 modo di osservare - cos\u00ec luminoso da essere potenzialmente pericoloso per i nostri occhi, e quindi da non osservare direttamente! Tuttavia alcune delle stelle che vediamo di notte emettono molta pi\u00f9 luce del nostro Sole. Il fattore chiave che le fa apparire molto meno luminose, per un osservatore qui sulla terra, \u00e8 la distanza. L\u2019unica differenza \u00e8 la distanza. Anche la stella pi\u00f9 vicina, Alpha Centauri, si trova ad una distanza da noi pi\u00f9 di 256.000 volte maggiore di quella del Sole.\nFornire una stima delle distanze cosmiche \u00e8 un compito difficile. Anche le distanze all\u2019interno del nostro stesso sistema solare sono enormi per gli standard quotidiani. L\u2019unit\u00e0 astronomica, corrispondente alla distanza media tra Terra e Sole, \u00e8 di circa 150 milioni di kilometri.\nLa stella pi\u00f9 vicina, Alpha Centauri, \u00e8 a 4\u00b7103 Km di distanza. Numeri cos\u00ec giganteschi sono poco pratici, e gli astronomi hanno introdotto una maniera alternativa per scrivere le distanze. Niente si muove pi\u00f9 velocemente della luce, e gli astronomi hanno deciso di usare i tempi di percorrenza della luce come misura delle distanze dalle stelle pi\u00f9 vicine (i parsec e i suoi derivati, cos\u00ec come i redshift, sono utilizzati per distanze maggiori). Il Sole, ad esempio, dista circa 8 minuti-luce da noi: la luce impiega 8 minuti per viaggiare dal Sole a noi. Alpha Centauri dista 4,2 anni-luce.\n(Non lasciatevi confondere dalla presenza di termini come \u201cminuti\u201d o \u201canni\u201d in queste unit\u00e0 di misura. Minuti-luce e anni-luce sono misure di distanza, non di tempo).\nGli oggetti pi\u00f9 distanti che conosciamo sono molto pi\u00f9 lontani. La luce impiega miliardi di anni per coprire la distanza tra questi oggetti e noi, perci\u00f2 essi si trovano a miliardi di anni-luce di distanza (dell\u2019ordine di 1022, cio\u00e8 decine di sestilioni, di kilometri). Nessun metodo unico pu\u00f2 coprire un simile intervallo di distanze. Invece, gli astronomi si basano su quella che chiamano la scala delle distanze cosmiche, dove i metodi applicati agli oggetti pi\u00f9 distanti sono calibrati utilizzando metodi applicabili ad oggetti meno distanti.\n\n**Luminosit\u00e0 apparente: la formula dell\u2019inverso del quadrato**\n\nDiversi importanti metodi di misurazione delle distanze astronomiche si rifanno al seguente principio di base: Supponiamo di conoscere quanta luce un oggetto emette (questo valore \u00e8 chiamato \u201cluminosit\u00e0 intrinseca\u201d). Possiamo misurare la luminosit\u00e0 apparente dell\u2019oggetto nel cielo. Il rapporto tra la luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca e apparente \u00e8 direttamente correlato alla distanza tra noi e l\u2019oggetto. Quantitativamente, assumiamo che l\u2019oggetto emetta una energia L al secondo, e che questa emissione non abbia una direzione preferenziale (sia cio\u00e8 isotropica). L \u00e8 detta la luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca dell\u2019oggetto. Alla distanza d dall\u2019oggetto, questa energia totale si sar\u00e0 distribuita su una superficie sferica di area 4\u03c0d2. Immaginiamo che il nostro rilevatore - ad esempio, lo specchio del nostro telescopio - copra un\u2019area A, come mostrato nella figura seguente, situata a distanza d dall\u2019oggetto radiante O:\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535-inverse-square.png)\n\nDato che l\u2019emissione luminosa dell\u2019oggetto \u00e8 diffusa uniformemente su tutta la sfera, il nostro rilevatore ne ricever\u00e0 solo una frazione A/(4\u03c0d2); in altre parole, il nostro rilevatore ricever\u00e0 l\u2019energia al secondo\n\nF=L\u22c5A/(4\u03c0d2)\n\ndall\u2019oggetto. Possiamo riscrivere questa formula dividendo per l\u2019area del rivelatore per ottenere l\u2019intensit\u00e0 della radiazione\n\nI=F/A=L/(4\u03c0d2)\n\novvero, l\u2019ammontare di energia per secondo per unit\u00e0 d\u2019area del rilevatore che ci arriva da un dato oggetto. Questa \u00e8 la celebre \u201clegge dell\u2019inverso del quadrato\u201d per la radiazione. Solitamente questa legge viene dimostrata in classe ponendo un fotorivelatore, come un piccolo pannello solare, a diverse distanze da una fonte di luce (ad es. Stanger 2008)\n\n**Candele standard**\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535_galaxy.jpg) \n**Immagine**: Le supernove di tipo Ia, come questa del 1994 nella galassia NGC 4526, sono candele standard che permettono agli astronomi di dedurre la distanza di galassie lontanissime.

CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode\n\nLa legge dell\u2019inverso del quadrato mette in relazione le quantit\u00e0 I, L e d. Immaginiamo una classe di oggetti i cui componenti hanno tutti la stessa luminosit\u00e0 L. Questi oggetti sono chiamati candele standard. Ogni volta che ne osserviamo una, ne conosciamo la luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca L, possiamo misurarne l\u2019intensit\u00e0 I, e usare la legge dell\u2019inverso del quadrato per calcolare la distanza dell\u2019oggetto.\nLe supernove dette \u201cdi tipo Ia\u201d sono le pi\u00f9 importanti candele standard per galassie molto distanti, nell\u2019ambito della cosmologia, ovvero la scienza che studia l\u2019Universo nel suo complesso. Queste supernove sono violente esplosioni termonucleari di stelle nane bianche. Sono estremamente brillanti, e visibili a grandi distanze. La tipologia di una supernova pu\u00f2 essere determinata dalle propriet\u00e0 della luce che riceviamo dall\u2019esplosione (pi\u00f9 concretamente, dallo spettro della supernova). Una volta chiaro che stiamo effettivamente osservando una supernova di questo tipo, possiamo dedurre la (massima) luminosit\u00e0 dell\u2019esplosione.\nPer la maggior parte delle candele standard astronomiche, L non \u00e8 costante per tutti gli oggetti dello stesso tipo, ma \u00e8 invece correlata con una propriet\u00e0 misurabile di quella classe di oggetti. L\u2019esempio pi\u00f9 famoso sono le stelle variabili Cefeidi, che presentano periodiche variazioni di luminosit\u00e0. Il periodo di queste variazioni \u00e8 correlato con la luminosit\u00e0 della stella; misurandone il periodo possiamo dedurne la luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca L. Questa correlazione fu scoperta e sfruttata per la prima volta da Henrietta Swan Leavitt tra il 1908 e il 1912.\nCandele standard come queste hanno giocato un ruolo chiave nella storia dell\u2019astronomia. All\u2019inizio del ventesimo secolo, le Cefeidi furono usate per dimostrare che la nostra galassia era solo una tra tante. E, negli ultimi anni dello scorso secolo, le supernove di tipo Ia sono state usate per dimostrare che l\u2019espansione cosmica sta accelerando - la scoperta dell\u2019Energia Oscura, che \u00e8 stata premiata con il premio Nobel per la Fisica 2011.\nLa candela standard ideale dovrebbe essere estremamente luminosa, e quindi visibile a grandi distanze, facilmente identificabile (ad es. tramite la determinazione dello spettro) e abbastanza comune da permettere una grande intervallo di misure di distanza. Idealmente, vorremmo avere alcuni esempi molto vicini di questo tipo di candele standard nel nostro \u201cvicinato cosmico\u201d, che permettano di calibrare la candela standard (ovvero misurarne la luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca L) e molti esempi a grande distanza che permettano la misurazione della distanza delle galassie e misure di tipo cosmologico.\nIn realt\u00e0, nessun singolo tipo di candela standard soddisfa tutti questi criteri. Invece, gli astronomi hanno costruito una scala delle distanze tramite diverse candele standard. Ad esempio la distanza di quasi 300 variabili Cefeidi pu\u00f2 essere misurata direttamente utilizzando geometria elementare (parallasse stellare). Queste distanze note possono essere usate per calibrare la relazione periodo-luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca delle Cefeidi. Una volta determinata questa relazione, possiamo esaminare vicine supernove di tipo Ia in galassie che contengano Cefeidi. Utilizzando le distanze delle Cefeidi, possiamo determinare le luminosit\u00e0 intrinseche di picco delle supernove di tipo Ia. Una volta noti questi valori, possiamo utilizzare le supernove di tipo Ia come candele standard talmente luminose da poter essere viste a distanze extragalattiche e cosmologiche considerevoli.\nL\u2019attivit\u00e0 qui presentata permetter\u00e0 ai vostri studenti di scoprire e approfondire in autonomia i principi chiave delle candele standard, utilizzando un esempio semplice in un contesto quotidiano.\n\n**Candele standard e la legge dell\u2019inverso del quadrato**\n\nNella pratica, misurare quantitativamente delle intensit\u00e0 \u00e8 una sfida notevole, che richiede un\u2019attenta calibrazione degli strumenti che va oltre l\u2019ambito di questa attivit\u00e0. Sfrutteremo invece il fatto di eseguire misure di varie sorgenti sempre con lo stesso unico strumento, la nostra fotocamera digitale.\nSupponendo di ricevere luce di intensit\u00e0 I da un oggetto, la nostra fotocamera raccoglier\u00e0 una quantit\u00e0 complessiva di luce al secondo pari a P=I\u22c5A\u22c5\u03b7, dove A \u00e8 l\u2019area di raccolta della fotocamera e \u03b7<1 \u00e8 una costante adimensionale che ci permette di tener conto che (a) parte della luce verr\u00e0 assorbita all\u2019interno della lente della fotocamera e (b) che parte della luce potrebbe non raggiungere il chip della fotocamera ma essere diffusa altrove. L\u2019energia totale depositata sul chip \u00e8 E=P\u22c5t, dove t \u00e8 il tempo di esposizione. Supponendo che nella nostra immagine l\u2019oggetto in esame occupi una certa regione di pixel e assumendo una risposta lineare del chip e una elaborazione lineare dell\u2019immagine, allora E sar\u00e0 proporzionale alla somma S dei valori dei pixel di quella regione (una parte opzionale dell\u2019attivit\u00e0 comprende una verifica di questa linearit\u00e0).\nCi\u00f2 che semplifica notevolmente il nostro lavoro \u00e8 la dipendenza lineare della somma S dei valori dei pixel dall\u2019intensit\u00e0 I. A patto di prestare attenzione ad acquisire tutte le nostre immagini nelle stesse condizioni (stesso tempo di esposizione, stessa lente, stesse impostazioni), questa linearit\u00e0 ci permetter\u00e0 di confrontare i valori delle intensit\u00e0 I1,2 di sorgenti diverse comparando le somme S1,2 dei valori dei pixel delle immagini di queste sorgenti,\n\nS1/S2=I1/I2\n\nPi\u00f9 semplice di cos\u00ec non pu\u00f2 essere, e questa semplice formula, assieme alla formula dell\u2019inverso del quadrato che collega luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca, intensit\u00e0 e distanza, saranno le basi dell\u2019attivit\u00e0 seguente\n\n**Come svolgere questa attivit\u00e0**\n\nQuesta attivit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 essere svolta a diversi livelli, a seconda sia del livello di autonomia durante l\u2019attivit\u00e0 (ovvero da quanto del lavoro \u00e8 gi\u00e0 stato preparato dall\u2019insegnante) e dal livello di analisi. Per quanto concerne i preparativi, nella versione pi\u00f9 semplice dell\u2019attivit\u00e0, l\u2019insegnante ispeziona uno o pi\u00f9 luoghi adeguati, si occupa di predisporre il software necessario e di compilare delle istruzioni semplificate per il suo utilizzo. Gli studenti possono quindi concentrarsi sulla parte scientifica, ovvero sulle misure e la loro valutazione. Questo livello di preparazione consente il pi\u00f9 rapido svolgimento dell\u2019esercizio. Se, invece, l\u2019attivit\u00e0 viene predisposta come un\u2019indagine completamente libera, gli studenti dovranno trovare da s\u00e9 un luogo adatto, ricercare software appropriato (ad esempio per aprire immagini RAW in formato FITS od un altro formato adatto per le analisi) e installarlo. Questo rende l\u2019esperienza molto pi\u00f9 realistica, dato che simili preparativi sono parte standard della ricerca astronomica, ma, naturalmente, anche molto pi\u00f9 dispendiosa in termini di tempo. Il livello pi\u00f9 elementare di analisi usa direttamente la legge dell\u2019inverso del quadrato per correlare luminosit\u00e0 misurata e distanza, usando un oggetto di riferimento la cui distanza sia stata misurata con metodi convenzionali (direttamente oppure utilizzando una mappa, ad es. Google Maps). Questa versione dell\u2019esercizio si concentra sul concetto fondamentale da apprendere e permette il suo pi\u00f9 rapido completamento.\nCome attivit\u00e0 aggiuntiva, \u00e8 possibile approfondire il ruolo della fotocamera digitale. Come mostrato sopra, l\u2019uso della fotocamera per misurare la luminosit\u00e0 apparente attraverso semplici rapporti tra somme di valori di pixel dipende da una relazione lineare tra l\u2019ammontare di luce ricevuta da una certa regione del panorama in esame e i valori di luminosit\u00e0 per i corrispondenti pixel dell\u2019immagine. Questa linearit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 essere verificata in attivit\u00e0 di supplemento opzionali che possono costituire, allo stesso tempo, un primo passo verso attivit\u00e0 di astrofotografia pi\u00f9 avanzate. Ad un livello pi\u00f9 avanzato, gli studenti dovrebbero essere incoraggiati a riflettere sulle cause delle deviazioni delle distanze da loro ricavate da quelle misurate direttamente. Le due cause principali di errore con cui dovranno probabilmente fare i conti saranno variazioni di luminosit\u00e0 intrinseche (ovvero deviazioni dall\u2019assunzione di base che le sorgenti siano candele standard) e oscuramento (l\u2019attenuazione della luce osservata di un oggetto ad opera di materia interposta tra esso e l\u2019osservatore). Entrambe possiedono degli analoghi in astronomia, dove la supposizione di base che le sorgenti siano candele standard (stessa luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca) deve essere spesso perfezionata (ad es. per le supernove di tipo Ia, utilizzando una correlazione tra l\u2019evoluzione nel tempo della loro curva di luce e la loro luminosit\u00e0 massima), e dove nubi di polvere e di gas possono attenuare la luce di una sorgente distante. In questo esercizio, siamo nella fortunata situazione di poterci avvicinare (\u2018viaggiare verso\u2019) le nostre sorgenti di luce, e misurare direttamente la loro luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca. Gli studenti possono eseguire queste misure e applicare una correzione corrispondente alle loro derivazioni della distanza. Questo dovrebbe ridurre considerevolmente le deviazioni. Nell\u2019esempio svolto possiamo anche identificare gli oscuramenti; ad esempio, quei lampioni che apparivano pi\u00f9 tenui di quanto ci si aspettasse si rivelano in effetti oscurati da dei rami. Anche se il livello avanzato richiede molto pi\u00f9 tempo, esso insegna preziose abilit\u00e0 di analisi dei dati e delle sorgenti di errore.\nUn esempio svolto con misure di luminosit\u00e0 apparente e correzioni, con incluse immagini di esempio e un esempio di foglio di calcolo, pu\u00f2 essere reperito all\u2019indirizzo http://www.haus-der-astronomie.de/materials/distances/street-lights", "fulldesc": "Questa descrizione inizia con la versione base, dove l\u2019insegnante ha gi\u00e0 identificato un luogo adatto con lampioni candele-standard e preparato il software necessario. Vengono inoltre forniti suggerimenti per versioni pi\u00f9 avanzate.\n\n**Preparazione da parte dell\u2019insegnante**:\n\nTrova una strada con lampioni adatti. I lampioni sono adeguati quando sono tutti dello stesso tipo o costruzione, e quando gli effetti geometrici non dominano la misura (per esempio luci piatte e quasi orizzontali saranno dominate da effetti di prospettiva/proiezione)\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535_laterne.png)\n**Immagine**: Esempio di un lampione che appare isotropico per un osservatore al livello del suolo.\n\nI lampioni dovrebbero illuminare il pi\u00f9 isotropicamente possibile; per scopi pratici, tutti i lampioni non collimati (ad es. da una struttura prismatica) dovrebbero andare bene.\nPrepara una catena di software per l\u2019acquisizione e l\u2019analisi dei dati. L\u2019esempio svolto, accessibile tramite il link pi\u00f9 in basso, utilizza Fitswork (http://www.fitswork.de/software/softw_en.php) per convertire immagini RAW Canon (.CR2) in formato FITS, preservando la linearit\u00e0. Sono possibili metodi diversi di conversione file, molti di essi basati su dcraw (https://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/). Per misurare la luminosit\u00e0 degli oggetti, utilizza ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Questo software ha il vantaggio di essere rilevante anche in astrofotografia (ad es. come AstroImageJ, http://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/), quindi gli studenti avranno la possibilit\u00e0 di riutilizzare le loro abilit\u00e0 software in altri progetti pi\u00f9 avanzati.\nPer una versione pi\u00f9 avanzata di questa attivit\u00e0, l\u2019individuazione del luogo e la scelta di una soluzione software possono essere lasciate agli studenti, anche se sar\u00e0 necessario un certo grado di assistenza e coordinazione.\n\n###Passo 1: Pratica con le immagini digitali\nIn questa parte, gli studenti apprendono e approfondiscono il significato dei valori dei pixel in un\u2019immagine digitale. Vengono loro assegnate le seguenti domande guida:\nUsando il software fornito, esaminate le immagini che avete acquisito con la fotocamera digitale.\nQual\u2019\u00e8 il rapporto tra valori dei pixel e luminosit\u00e0?\nCome potete catturare la luminosit\u00e0 di un oggetto nell\u2019immagine?\nQuesta parte dovrebbe includere l\u2019acquisizione di immagini di test di una sorgente di luce da parte degli studenti e il loro esame tramite software di analisi.\nLascia che gli studenti sperimentino esposizioni diverse; dovrebbero scoprire che ogni pixel satura ad una determinata luminosit\u00e0. Nell\u2019acquisizione di immagini per misure di luminosit\u00e0 \u00e8 quindi necessaria cura nella scelta dei tempi di esposizione: regioni saturate possono introdurre errori significativi!\nAlla fine di questa parte, gli studenti dovrebbero essere pratici con il software scelto da loro o dal docente per questa attivit\u00e0. Dovrebbero sapere come convertire immagini RAW dalla loro fotocamera digitale in FITS od un altro formato adatto, e come misurare la luminosit\u00e0 degli oggetti nelle loro immagini (ovvero tramite qualcosa di legato alla somma della luminosit\u00e0 dei pixel per la regione di pixel comprendente l\u2019oggetto). A seconda del tempo disponibile per l\u2019esercizio, questo passo dell\u2019attivit\u00e0 pu\u00f2 anche includere un esperimento per testare la linearit\u00e0. Ci sono almeno due modi possibili. Per il primo tipo di misura, una sorgente luminosa (ad esempio una lampada schermata o un led) viene fotografata con la fotocamera digitale utilizzando diversi tempi di esposizione, dimostrando la linearit\u00e0 in un grafico luminosit\u00e0-tempo di esposizione. Alternativamente, \u00e8 possibile mantenere invariata la configurazione della fotocamera e fotografare la stessa unica sorgente di luce a distanze diverse. In quel caso, se vale la linearit\u00e0, bisognerebbe ritrovare la legge dell\u2019inverso del quadrato per i diversi valori di luminosit\u00e0 dipendenti dalla distanza. L\u2019eventuale non-linearit\u00e0 porterebbe a deviazioni da questa semplice formula.\nIn quanto attivit\u00e0 che si possono svolgere in classe, durante il giorno, entrambi gli esperimenti possono servire come preparazione per l\u2019attivit\u00e0 sul campo, e permettere agli studenti di prendere pratica con l\u2019utilizzo della fotocamera e della catena di analisi dati.\n(Nel caso ci sia tempo, allora il confronto tra le misure di linearit\u00e0 basate su immagini JPG e quelle basate su immagini RAW convertite in FITS pu\u00f2 dimostrare in modo lampante perch\u00e9 sia necessario lavorare con immagini RAW!)\n\n###Passo 2: Misurazione di lampioni sul campo\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dc2c154e-ee67-4467-802a-ecae4d7c9192/astroedu1535_receding-streetlights.png)\n**Immagine**: linea di lampioni che prosegue per circa 600 metri. Riquadro: immagine ingrandita delle luci pi\u00f9 distanti.\n\nIn questa parte, gli studenti si recano sul luogo scelto dall\u2019insegnante (o sui luoghi da loro scelti) in condizioni sufficientemente buie (sera/notte) e acquisiscono una o pi\u00f9 immagini della fila di lampioni scelta. Sono possibili diverse strategie. Nell\u2019esempio svolto \u00e8 possibile trovare tutti i lampioni in una singola immagine. Alternativamente, \u00e8 possibile prendere una immagine per lampione, centrando ogni sorgente di luce nell\u2019immagine usata per misurare la sua luminosit\u00e0 (questo equivale ad una gita notturna; gli insegnanti dovrebbero assicurarsi di prendere le dovute precauzioni per garantire l\u2019incolumit\u00e0 dei propri studenti).\nBasandosi su quanto appreso sulla saturazione nella parte 1, gli studenti dovrebbero acquisire immagini con diversi tempi di esposizione (o, alternativamente, diversi valori di ISO o dell\u2019apertura), per essere sicuri di ottenere almeno un\u2019immagine non saturata. Per un lampione (solitamente il pi\u00f9 vicino!) la distanza dalla fotocamera dovrebbe essere misurata direttamente, per esempio utilizzando un metro a nastro od un dispositivo laser di misurazione delle distanze. Questa distanza sar\u00e0 usata per calibrare le misure delle candele standard.\n\n###Passo 3: Analisi delle immagini\nUna volta acquisite le immagini (o l\u2019immagine) utilizzate per le misure, queste possono essere analizzate. Nell\u2019esempio svolto, questo \u00e8 fatto convertendo le immagini in file FITS e misurando la luminosit\u00e0 di quelle aree dell\u2019immagine che comprendono i vari lampioni. In condizioni sufficientemente buie, la luminosit\u00e0 di fondo non dovrebbe giocare un ruolo significativo nelle misure. Se il fondo \u00e8 luminoso, o gli studenti sospettano che il fondo sia una fonte significativa di errore, sar\u00e0 necessario utilizzare strumenti di selezione appropriati per assicurarsi che le aree utilizzate per le misure di luminosit\u00e0 contengano solo contributi dai lampioni. Quando la luminosit\u00e0 di fondo non \u00e8 un problema, come nell\u2019esempio svolto, la luminosit\u00e0 dei lampioni pu\u00f2 essere misurata utilizzando semplici strumenti di selezione rettangolare o ellittica. I valori misurati dovrebbero essere tabulati, per esempio in un foglio di calcolo (come Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc o Google Fogli). I valori non sono in alcuna delle unit\u00e0 fisiche, ma essendo stati misurati nella stessa maniera, dovrebbero essere tutti nelle stesse (inusuali) unit\u00e0, permettendo il calcolo dei rapporti. Utilizzando il lampione di riferimento, la cui distanza \u00e8 stata misurata direttamente, oltre alla legge dell\u2019inverso del quadrato per l\u2019intensit\u00e0, potranno essere calcolate le distanze (secondo il metodo delle candele standard) degli altri lampioni.\n\n###Passo 4: Controllo incrociato\nIn astronomia \u00e8 necessario un confronto incrociato tra diversi metodi di determinazione delle distanze in maniera da esaminarne la validit\u00e0. Nell\u2019esempio dei lampioni, ci sono vari metodi di misura delle distanze alternativi (e pi\u00f9 diretti) da utilizzare come confronto.\nQuando i lampioni sono allineati lungo una strada dritta, la misura diretta delle distanze tra i lampioni, e da due dei lampioni alla posizione della fotocamera, fornir\u00e0 informazioni sufficienti per calcolare (utilizzando semplici equazioni lineari), la distanza di ogni lampione dalla fotocamera.\nLe misure dirette sono le pi\u00f9 facili da capire, ma svantaggiose in termini di tempi. Esse non dovrebbero essere compiute al momento del lavoro sul campo della Parte 2 (in quanto potrebbe spingere gli studenti a confondere le due misure, o a domandarsi perch\u00e9 le misure col metodo delle candele standard siano necessarie). Prevedere due eventi separati di misure sul campo per\u00f2 implica un considerevole investimento di tempo e, probabilmente, di pianificazione della logistica.\nAlternativamente, il controllo incrociato pu\u00f2 essere eseguito online, utilizzando le mappe online disponibili (come Google Maps o Open Street Map, https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Le misure di distanza possono essere effettuate sia nella classica modalit\u00e0 di Google Maps sia prendendo uno screenshot e misurando le distanze in un software di elaborazione immagini come Adobe Photoshop o Gimp (http://www.gimp.org/). Parallelamente all\u2019analisi col metodo delle candele standard, \u00e8 sensato utilizzare questi strumenti per determinare le distanze relative dei lampioni dalla fotocamera; il lampione di riferimento pu\u00f2 essere poi usato per tradurre queste ultime in distanze lineari.\nI risultati dovrebbero essere elaborati in un grafico per verificare la validit\u00e0 del metodo, confrontando i valori misurati direttamente e quelli ottenuti col metodo delle candele standard per i vari lampioni.\n\n###Passo 4 (livello avanzato): sorgenti di errore\nQuando le distanze ottenute con il metodo delle candele standard per i lampioni e le loro controparti misurate direttamente verranno poste a grafico rispetto al numero di lampione (o tra di loro), il risultato non sar\u00e0 proprio una linea retta.\nNelle versioni avanzate di questa attivit\u00e0, gli studenti sono invitati a riflettere sulle ragioni di queste deviazioni.\nGli studenti dovrebbero rendersi conto che alcune delle deviazioni sono casuali - che \u00e8 possibile che sia l\u2019acquisizione dell\u2019immagine che la misura introducano piccoli errori in entrambe le direzioni.\nDue tipologie di errore sistematico sono particolarmente importanti, sia in quanto possiedono analoghi nella misura delle distanze astronomiche, sia perch\u00e9 \u00e8 ragionevolmente probabile si verifichino nell\u2019esercizio con i lampioni.\nIl primo errore sistematico deriva dalla limitazione di assumere che le sorgenti luminose siano candele standard. Anche se \u00e8 probabile che lampioni dello stesso tipo abbiano luminosit\u00e0 molto simili, saranno verosimilmente presenti delle variazioni intrinseche. Ad esempio, potrebbero esserci effetti di usura della sorgente di luce utilizzata. In astronomia non \u00e8 possibile recarsi presso le nostre candele standard per misurarne la luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca; questo necessita dei test sistematici che utilizzino metodi alternativi di misura della distanza per determinare se le possibili candele standard di un determinato tipo mostrino variazioni dipendenti da varie loro propriet\u00e0 misurabili (ad es. per le supernove Ia, le variazioni di luminosit\u00e0 di picco che sono correlate con la forma della curva di luce).\nNell\u2019esercizio dei lampioni, gli studenti possono invece provare a misurare direttamente le variazioni di luminosit\u00e0 intrinseca, ad es. raggiungendo a piedi i vari lampioni e acquisendone l\u2019immagine da una distanza e un angolo standard (per i lettori pratici con il sistema astronomico delle magnitudini utilizzato per misurare le luminosit\u00e0: acquisire un\u2019immagine ad una distanza standard corrisponde a definire una magnitudine assoluta).\nIl secondo errore sistematico ha luogo ogni volta che parte di una sorgente luminosa \u00e8 oscurata rispetto alla prospettiva dell\u2019osservatore. I lampioni possono essere nascosti da rami o foglie, o da sporco presente sul lampione stesso; gli oggetti astronomici possono trovarsi dietro nubi di gas e polvere, portando a fenomeni di estinzione. Questo errore sistematico far\u00e0 sempre apparire la sorgente come meno brillante; dovrebbe essere preso in considerazione ogni volta che la misura di luminosit\u00e0 di un lampione restituisce un valore inaspettatamente basso, corrispondente ad una distanza calcolata col metodo delle candele standard inaspettatamente grande. In alcuni casi, l\u2019oscuramento pu\u00f2 essere trovato e documentato, o anche corretto. Nell\u2019esempio svolto, un\u2019immagine presa ad un maggiore ingrandimento ha mostrato la presenza di foglie che oscuravano parte di un lampione che era apparso alle misurazioni come sorprendentemente fioco. Dall\u2019immagine ingrandita, si \u00e8 potuta determinare la frazione di oscuramento, e applicare una corrispondente correzione alla luminosit\u00e0.", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "I risultati pi\u00f9 notevoli ottenuti utilizzando le supernove di tipo Ia sono illustrati nella lezione da Nobel di Brian Schmidt: https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/schmidt-lecture.html\nInformazioni approfondite sulle misure col metodo delle candele standard come quelle mostrate in questa attivit\u00e0 possono essere trovate nei libri di testo di astronomia:\n\n- de Grijs, R. 2011: An Introduction to Distance Measurement in Astronomy.

Se ne pu\u00f2 sentire l\u2019odore, il sapore o la sensazione al tatto? (Probabilmente la risposta sar\u00e0 no.

(ad esempio si pu\u00f2 vedere la polvere in un raggio di sole o del fumo).\n- Se svuotiamo questa stanza (rimuoviamo oggetti e persone), cosa rimane? (Niente? Ne siete sicuri? Rimane l\u2019aria a riempire lo spazio vuoto).\n\nNota: Gli studenti prenderanno parte alle seguenti attivit\u00e0 individualmente o in piccoli gruppi. Gli studenti dovranno discutere in piccoli gruppi o scrivere cosa pensano stia accadendo in ogni attivit\u00e0.\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 1: Riempire un palloncino d\u2019aria\n\n### Passo 1\nPrendete un palloncino e gonfiatelo (ad esempio riempitelo con dell\u2019aria, ma senza farlo esplodere!)\n\n### Passo 2\nPotete descrivere cosa accade? (Quando l\u2019aria dai vostri polmoni entra all\u2019interno del palloncino, occupa spazio. Il palloncino si espande perch\u00e9 l\u2019aria al suo interno ha bisogno di spazio).\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 2: Riempire una siringa di aria e sentire la spinta dell\u2019aria\n\n### Passo 1\nTirate lo stantuffo della siringa verso di voi, poi spingetelo di nuovo nel tubo della siringa. \u00c8 stato facile? Cosa succedeva all\u2019interno della siringa? (La siringa si \u00e8 riempita di aria che \u00e8 stata nuovamente spinta fuori).\n\n### Passo 2\nTirate di nuovo lo stantuffo, questa volta coprite l\u2019altro lato della siringa con il vostro dito. Premete lo stantuffo. \u00c8 stato facile? Cosa avete provato? Potete spiegare cos\u2019\u00e8 successo all\u2019interno della siringa? C\u2019\u00e8 stata qualche differenza questa volta, se s\u00ec perch\u00e9? (\u00c8 facile spingere un pochino lo stantuffo, ma diventa pi\u00f9 difficile perch\u00e9 l\u2019aria intrappolata nella siringa resiste alla spinta. Pi\u00f9 l\u2019aria viene compressa, pi\u00f9 \u00e8 difficile spingere lo stantuffo).\n\n### Passo 3\nLasciate andare lo stantuffo. Cosa succede? (Lo stantuffo torna indietro e poi si ferma). Perch\u00e9 credete sia successo? (L\u2019aria che era compressa nella siringa si ri-espande al suo stato originale e spinge lo stantuffo in fuori).\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 3: Controllare il movimento con una siringa collegata alle estremit\u00e0 di un tubo di plastica\nUsando due siringhe della stessa dimensione:\n\n### Passo 1\nSpingete lo stantuffo di una delle siringhe completamente e collegatela al tubo di plastica.\n\n### Passo 2\nSpingete solo parzialmente lo stantuffo dell\u2019altra e collegatela all\u2019altra estremit\u00e0 del tubo di plastica (Questo \u00e8 necessario per far s\u00ec che le siringhe non vengano espulse se gli studenti spingono con troppa foga).\n\n### Passo 3\nPensate a cosa potrebbe succedere quando spingete in dentro o tirate fuori lo stantuffo di una delle due siringhe. Ora sperimentate e osservate! (spingendo uno stantuffo in dentro, l\u2019altro verr\u00e0 spinto in fuori dall\u2019aria)\n\n### Passo 4\nPerch\u00e9 succede questo? (L\u2019aria intrappolata in uno spazio ha la capacit\u00e0 di spostare oggetti se viene compressa)\n\n### Passo 5\n\u00c8 possibile confrontare gli spostamenti dei due stantuffi? (Si sono mossi di circa la stessa quantit\u00e0)\n\n### Passo 6\nRipetete l\u2019attivit\u00e0 usando due siringhe di dimensioni diverse.\n\n### Passo 7\nPensate che anche questa volta gli stantuffi si sposteranno della stessa quantit\u00e0? Provate! Cosa notate? C\u2019\u00e8 una qualche connessione tra la dimensione delle siringhe e la distanza di cui si spostano i loro stantuffi? (Se spingiamo lo stantuffo di una siringa pi\u00f9 piccola, quello della siringa grande verr\u00e0 spostato di poco, viceversa, una siringa pi\u00f9 grande sposter\u00e0 lo stantuffo di una pi\u00f9 piccola di molto).\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 4: riempire una cannuccia con dell\u2019acqua\nBloccate il fondo di una cannuccia stretta con un gommino adesivo tipo Pattafix. Cercate di riempire la cannuccia versando dell\u2019acqua da sopra con contagocce. \u00c8 stato difficile? Se s\u00ec, perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 stato facile? (L\u2019aria riempiva la cannuccia e non c\u2019era spazio per dell\u2019acqua). Rimuovete lentamente il gommino. Cosa succede e perch\u00e9? (L\u2019acqua inizia a scendere perch\u00e9 l\u2019aria esce dal fondo della cannuccia).\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 5: fazzoletto asciutto in acqua\n### Passo 1\nAppallottolate un fazzoletto in una palla e spingetelo fermamente sul fondo di un bicchiere alto in modo che non caschi se il bicchiere viene capovolto (un paio di fazzoletti ben compattati hanno meno possibilit\u00e0 di cadere di un singolo fazzoletto). Pensate a cosa potrebbe succedere al fazzoletto se il bicchiere viene immerso capovolto in acqua.\n\n### Passo 2    \nCapovolgete il bicchiere sottosopra e inseritelo nella ciotola contenente l\u2019acqua facendo attenzione a non inclinarlo. Tiratelo fuori e tastate il fazzoletto. Cosa notate? Perch\u00e9 pensate che il fazzoletto non si sia bagnato? (L\u2019aria ha impedito all\u2019acqua di entrare nel bicchiere).\n\n### Passo 3\nDiscutete di dove possono esserci sacche di aria: tubi dell\u2019acqua, canoe ribaltate, radiatori per il riscaldamento, ecc.\n\n### Passo 4\n- Discutete di cos\u2019\u00e8 un vuoto.\n- Come chiamate lo strato di aria che circonda la Terra? (Atmosfera)\n- Cosa succede quando gli oggetti impattano l\u2019atmosfera? (La discussione pu\u00f2 contenere argomenti come il calore causato dovuto all\u2019attrito. Gli studenti possono sfregare o battere le mani \u2013 cosa sentono? Gli aerei prendono fuoco per l\u2019intenso calore quando precipitano).\n- Pensate alle astronavi che ritornano a terra ad alte velocit\u00e0 dopo una missione nello spazio, cosa incontrano come prima cosa? (L\u2019aria, l\u2019atmosfera) Cosa pensate che debbano fare quando rientrano? (Rallentare). Altrimenti cosa accadrebbe? (Si distruggerebbe e brucerebbe). \n- Come pensate che le astronavi possano non prendere fuoco? (Sono coperte in materiali isolanti e rallentano durante il rientro).\n\n**Misure di sicurezza**: Nell\u2019attivit\u00e0 3 usate sempre siringhe sterili che non sono state usati per fini medici. State inoltre attenti alle dimensioni delle siringhe \u2013 una siringa grande pu\u00f2 spingere una pi\u00f9 piccola con una grande forza.\n\n**Matematica**: Proporre queste domandi agli studenti\n1) L\u2019aria \u00e8 una miscela di gas che consiste di azoto, ossigeno, anidride carbonica, argon e altri gas\n\n- Approssimativamente che percentuale dell\u2019aria consiste di (i) azoto e (ii) ossigeno?\n- Qual \u00e8 approssimativamente il rapporto tra azoto e ossigeno nell\u2019aria?\n- Puoi convertire queste percentuali in numeri decimali?\n\n2) Nell\u2019attivit\u00e0 3, usate due siringhe di diverse dimensioni connesse da un tubo, calcolate il rapporto tra le dimensioni delle due siringhe. Misura poi la distanza di cui le due siringhe si sono mosse.\n\n- C\u2019\u00e8 un legame tra questi due rapporti?\n- Investiga quale combinazione di siringhe d\u00e0 il maggior movimento.\n\n**Analisi/Conclusioni**: L\u2019aria occupa spazio (anche se non la possiamo vedere).\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 supplementare: riempire una bottiglia usando un imbuto\n### Passo 1\nAppoggiate l\u2019imbuto alla bocca di una bottiglia e chiedete agli studenti di pensare a cosa accadr\u00e0 quando versano dell\u2019acqua nell\u2019imbuto.\n\n### Passo 2\nChiedete agli studenti di versare acqua nell\u2019imbuto e osservate cosa succede (l\u2019acqua riempir\u00e0 la bottiglia).\n\n### Passo 3\nOra assicurate l\u2019imbuto alla bottiglia in modo tale che non ci sia spazio tra i due. **QUESTO SPAZIO DEVE ESSERE ERMETICO**. Gli studenti dovranno pensare nuovamente a cosa accadr\u00e0 una volta che verr\u00e0 versata dell\u2019acqua nell\u2019imbuto. Fategli poi versare dell\u2019acqua nell\u2019imbuto.\n**Nota**: Pu\u00f2 essere difficile ottenere una chiusura completamente ermetica. Un O-ring di gomma o una guarnizione, disponibili nei negozi di fai da te, posti attorno al collo dell\u2019imbuto che dovr\u00e0 poi essere spinto poi bene nella bottiglia pu\u00f2 produrre un buon livello di ermeticit\u00e0 (anche del nastro adesivo stretto bene pu\u00f2 funzionare).\n\n### Passo 4\nOsservate cosa succede. Cosa vedete? Cosa sentite? Perch\u00e9 l\u2019acqua ha fatto difficolt\u00e0 ad entrare nella bottiglia? (L\u2019aria occupava l\u2019interno della bottiglia e si \u00e8 opposta all\u2019acqua). Cos\u2019altro notate? (Se lo spazio tra imbuto e bottiglia \u00e8 completamente ermetico, l\u2019acqua non entrer\u00e0 nella bottiglia perch\u00e9 l\u2019aria \u00e8 intrappolata al suo interno e si opporr\u00e0. Se vi \u00e8 una leggera fuga di aria, vi sar\u00e0 un suono \u2013 glug glug \u2013 dell\u2019acqua che entra mentre le bolle di aria escono dalla fuga).\n\n### Gli studenti possono\n- Scoprire di pi\u00f9 sul perch\u00e9 i radiatori in cui \u00e8 presente dell\u2019aria non riscaldano bene \u2013 restrizioni o impedimenti nel flusso (vedi anche [*air lock*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_lock)) e come l\u2019aria viene rilasciata\n- Esplorare i cinque strati che compongono l\u2019atmosfera \u2013 scoprire i loro nomi e a quale livello si trovano nuvole, aeroplani, lo strato di ozono, satelliti, la stazione spaziale ecc. Vedere la sezione ulteriori informazioni per link utili.\n\n### Lo sapevi che\u2026?\nNell\u2019ottobre 2014 l\u2019astronave Dragon di Space X, mentre tornava a terra portando un carico di campioni biologici dalla Stazione Spaziale Internazionale (comprese alcune piante cresciute nello spazio), ha prodotto un intenso calore durante il rientro in atmosfera. La temperatura ha raggiunto quasi 3000\u00b0 Fahrenheit (1649\u00b0 Celsius). Fortunatamente l\u2019astronave era protetta da uno scudo termico molto resistente.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/5d6b3abf-8a0a-4e38-aaf5-a4d16c5836d8/astroedu1603-space-station.jpg) \nImage credit: NASA/SpaceX\n\nLuned\u00ec 19 gennaio 2015 un fotografo amatoriale ha fotografato un bolide sopra l\u2019isola di Dalkey nella Contea di South Dublin, in Irlanda.

La luce visibile compone una significativa piccola porzione dell\u2019intero spettro della radiazione elettromagnetica, o luce, dove circa 400 nm coincide con il colore viola (lunghezza d\u2019onda minore) e 700 nm coincide con il colore rosso (lunghezza d\u2019onda maggiore). Si ritiene che la luce viaggi pi\u00f9 veloce di qualunque altra cosa nell\u2019universo, a circa 300,000 km al secondo. Tuttavia, questo ha ancora l\u2019implicazione che limita la possibilit\u00e0 per qualunque cosa di viaggiare istantaneamente. Per esempio, anche se sembra che la luce del Sole ci raggiunga istantaneamente, se il Sole diventasse improvvisamente scuro ci vorrebbero circa 8 minuti per chiunque sulla Terra ad accorgersene, dato che ci sono 149 milioni di km tra la Terra e il Sole.\nQuesti dati sulla luce hanno effetto sul trasferimento dell\u2019informazione attraverso la tecnologia tanto quanto sullo studio dell\u2019astronomia. Prima ndi tutto, dato che la luce pu\u00f2 viaggiare pi\u00f9 velocemente di qualunque cosa nell\u2019universo, questo fa s\u00ec che essa sia un mezzo perfetto per trasferire l\u2019informazione in maniera apparentemente istantanea. Le fibre ottiche sono una nuova tecnologia che si propone di trarre vantaggio dalla velocit\u00e0 della luce per trasferire l\u2019informazione a tali velocit\u00e0. Queste fibre sono flessibili, estremamente sottili, trasparenti, e fatte con vetro estruso di alta qualit\u00e0 o di plastica. Questo le rende un\u2019opzione perfetta per il trasferimento di informazione in una serie di situazioni che potrebbero includere angoli di svolta o curve e proteggere l\u2019informazione in trasferimento da impatti esterni (che potrebbero impedire all\u2019informazione di raggiungere la propria destinazione).\nUn uso comune di questa tecnologia \u00e8 internet. Attraverso il suo uso, le velocit\u00e0 di internet sono significativamente aumentate e sono pi\u00f9 affidabili. Inoltre, questa tecnologia \u00e8 stata usata per creare il Fibre-Optic Link around the Globe, che usa cavi in fibra ottica distesi (in gran parte) sul fondale oceanico per collegare la costa est dell\u2019America del Nord fino al Giappone.\nQuesta tecnologia ha avuto anche molto impatto nello studio dell\u2019astronomia. Acluni strumenti di ricerca in astronomia che usano la fibra ottica, includono spettroscopia multi-oggetto, spettroscopia bidimensionale, spettroscopia ad alta precisione di velocit\u00e0 radiale, interferometria e fotometria. Una discussione pi\u00f9 profonda di questi usi pu\u00f2 essere trovata nell\u2019articolo \u201cThe Astronomical Uses of Optical Fibers\u201d che appare nell\u2019ASP Conference Series, Vol. 152 by Ian R. Parry. Lo spettrografo in Fibra Multi-Oggetto (FMOS) \u00e8 usato in astronomia per raccogliere la luce da diverse stelle o galassie allo stesso tempo, permettendo di avere una grande serie di informazioni a partire da una variet\u00e0 di obiettivi che devono essere osservati e raccolti simultaneamente, consentendo sia studi sulla formazione ed evoluzione galattica sia altri studi.  La Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) \u00e8 un esempio su tutti di come la tecnologia viene usata per svolgere grandi cose. Un trapano perfora una lastra eseguendo buchi precisi; tale lamina va montata sul telescopio in modo che i buchi coincidano con i molti oggetti che verranno osservati contemporaneamente. Un cavo in fibra ottica viene inserito in ciascun buco, in modi che solo la luce proveniente da cascun oggetto venga raccolta dal rispettivo cavo in fibra ottica e spedita verso uno spettrografo che, poi, pu\u00f2 analizzare la luce da quell\u2019oggetto e conoscerlo meglio. In questo modo, migliaia di oggetti nell\u2019universo vengono osservati e studiati con precisione per le loro propriet\u00e0, simultaneamente. La SDSS, iniziata nel 2000, ha avuto diverse fasi nelle quali pi\u00f9 di un terzo del cielo notturno \u00e8 stato indagato e sono stati raccolti gli spettri di 5 milioni di stelle e galassie. I dati della SDSS sono disponibili pubblicamente e vengono usati anche per programmi educativi come lo Zooniverse\u2019s Galaxy Zoo che invita chiunque voglia essere un *citizen scientisti* (\"*scienziato cittadino*\") a esplorare i dati di SDSS per identificare le galassie osservate dalla SDSS.", "fulldesc": "### Preparazione\nPrima dell\u2019inizio dell\u2019attivit\u00e0, l\u2019insegnante prepari una nota o un piccolo oggetto divertente da nascondere nello scomparto all\u2019interno della palla. Gli studenti si alzeranno per la dimostrazione e si disporranno casualmente nella stanza. Dopo aver gettato la palla, verr\u00e0 tracciato un perscorso con un cavo, verranno distribuiti gli specchi, e un puntatore laser sar\u00e0 consegnato al primo studente, mentre l\u2019ultimo ha un bersaglio.\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 1: Demo Dettagliata \u2013 Luce e Fibre Ottiche\n**1.** Iniziare con una spiegazione sui pericoli dei laser e le norme di sicurezza in modo che tutti gli studenti usino il laser in maniera responsabile. Se sono disponibili occhiali di sicurezza per laser, farli indossare agli studenti, se non lo sono, magari limitare il numero di studenti che usano laser e specchi a un numero inferiore, per evitare qualsiasi rischio che il laser colpisca qualcuno negli occhi.\n\n**2.** Cominciare con tutti in piedi, sparsi nella stanza in maniera casuale. Successivamente, far gridare allo studente iniziale qualcosa attraverso la stanza rivolgendosi allo studente finale. Chiedere agli studenti cosa dovrebbero fare per far passare il proprio messaggio da una parte all\u2019altra se non possono urlare all\u2019altra persona attraverso la stanza.\n\n**3.** Poi, far sussurrare allo studente iniziale la propria frase alla persona pi\u00f9 vicina, e procedere in modo che ogni studente sussurri ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato detto per tutta la stanza, passando attraverso ogni studente, terminando con lo studente finale. Far rivelare all\u2019ultimo studente ci\u00f2 che era stato detto in origine. Questo \u00e8 un buon mkomento per parlare dei problemi delle differenti opzioni di comunicazione e di come a volte il messaggio potrebbe diventare \u201cconfuso\u201d. \n\n**4.** Ora dare la palla con all\u2019interno la nota al primo studente e dire agli studenti di iniziare a lanciare la palla attraverso la stanza in modo che ognuno la prenda e la passi fino a farle raggiungere l\u2019ultimo studente. Segnare il percorso tracciato dalla palla con la lunghezza di una cavo di plastica trasparente. Lo studente finale rimuover\u00e0 la nota contenuta nella palla e riveler\u00e0 cosa dice. Chiedere agli studenti se c\u2019\u00e8 qualcosa che potrebbe fare lo stesso percorso della palla e condurre l\u2019informazione a destinazione.\n\n**5.** Distribuire gli specchi a tutti quelli in mezzo, un puntatore laser alla prima persona, e un bersaglio all\u2019ultima persona.\n\n**6.** Dire agli studenti che ora devono ricreare il percorso tracciato dalla palla, ma con il puntatore laser e usando gli specchi per riflettere la luce verso il bersaglio (ATTENZIONE: Non puntare il laser verso gli occhi. Informare completamente gli studenti sull\u2019uso del laser prima che cominci l\u2019attivit\u00e0, ricordandolo agli studenti ancora una volta a questo punto, e se possibile includere occhiali di sicurezza.) Questa \u00e8 una buona occasione per discutere sui fotoni pi\u00f9 in dettaglio.\n\n**7.** Ora sfidare gli studenti a mandare il laser dal primo studente all\u2019ultimo attraverso lo stesso percorso fatto dalla palla (usare il cavo sul pavimento per ricordarlo). Gli studenti capiranno quasi immediatamente che usando cos\u00ec tanti specchi per far rimbalzare la luce laser non funzioner\u00e0, finire questa parte dell\u2019attivit\u00e0.\n\n**8.** Ora sfidare il primo studente e due studenti tra l\u2019ultimo studente a fare lo stesso, ma facendo rimbalzare soltanto la luce dai loro due specchi per colpire il bersaglio, e dovrebbe essere molto pi\u00f9 facile.\n\n**9.** (Se si sta usando il Comunicatore Radio Laser) Scambiare il laser ordinario con il laser radio e il bersaglio con il fotorecettore. Ora fare in modo che gli studenti facciano la stessa cosa in modo che colpendo il \u201cbersaglio\u201d (il fotorecettore) sentano la radio.\n\n**10.** Spiegare agli studenti come si pu\u00f2 usare la luce per trasferire l\u2019informazione. Se si sta usando il laser radio, si pu\u00f2 spiegare che la luminosit\u00e0 del laser sta cambiando in modo che l\u2019informazione sul suono della musica \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che sentiamo. Questo pu\u00f2 essere legato anche al modo in cui le configurazioni di 0 e 1 \u00e8 usata per trasferire l\u2019informazione come il codice morse e come gli 1 e gli 0 possono essere rappresentati dal laser luminoso o scuro. Mostrare agli studenti che ogniqualvolta il percorso della luce viene bloccato, la radio si ferma, mostrando che \u00e8 anche una forma di comunicazione imperfetta, in modo da condurre verso le domande successive.\n\n**11.** Chiedere agli studenti se c\u2019\u00e8 un altro modo in cui possiamo portare la luce del laser da un capo all\u2019altro, ma coinvolgendo tutti. Incoraggiare gli studenti a pensare alla situazione ideale, per esempio, se tutti riuscissero a rimanere perfettamente immobili, ma spiegare che non \u00e8 una situazione realmente plausibile. Incoraggiarli a pensare ad altri modi in cui questo pu\u00f2 essere fatto, fino a che non iniziano a immaginare di circondare il fascio laser con un tubo di specchi. Chiedere se, a quanto ne sanno, esiste una cosa del genere.\n\n**12.** Dire agli studenti di ricordare in che modo hanno fatto rimbalzare la luce, quindi chiedere di sollevare il cavo sul pavimento e fare in modo che l\u2019ultimo studente punti l\u2019estremo del cavo verso il bersaglio.\n\n**13.** Il primo studente dovrebbe ora prendere il laser che ha in mano e porlo a contatto con l\u2019estremo del cavo mentre accende il laser. La luce dovrebbe propagarsi attraverso la corda, riflettersi internamente, e uscire dall\u2019altro estremo colpendo il bersaglio. Chiedere agli studenti cosa \u00e8 appena successo. Dovrebbero fare il collegamento che la luce del laser rimbalza dentro il cavo e muovendosi attraverso di esso fino all\u2019estremit\u00e0 \u00e8 proprio come la soluzione proposta di molti specchi che circondano la luce laser.\n\n**14.** Spiegare la riflessione interna totale. Alcuni disegni sul bordo della luce che si riflette internamente attraverso il cavo potrebbero essere utili.\n\n**15.** Se si sta usando il radio laser, chiedere agli studenti se questo metodo funzionerebbe con esso.  Fare in modo che gli studenti scambino il punto di inizio e di fine ancora una volta con con il radio laser, ma questa volta far propagare il laser attraverso il cavo per colpire il fotorecettore. \n\n**16.** Chiedere se c\u2019\u00e8 un modo per bloccare il segnale ora.\nChiedere se sanno se qualcosa di simile a questo viene usato oggi. Dopo alcune risposte, tirare fuori la lampada in fibra ottica e mostrare che \u00e8 esattamente ci\u00f2 che accade, ma ad una scala inferiore con queste fibre ottiche che trasferiscono la luce nella lampada.\n\n**17.** E\u2019 un buon momento per mostrare la spiegazione video da YouTube \u201cFibre Optic Cables: How they Work.\u201d\n\n**18.** Ora che il concetto usato in fibra ottica \u00e8 compreso, si pu\u00f2 procedere con lo spiegare come questo venga applicato nel mondo reale. Come esempio, si potrebbe usare internet. L\u2019attivit\u00e0 seguente spiega come le fibre ottiche vengono usate in astronomia.\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 2: Costruire un modello di spettrografo Multi-oggetto\n![](/media/activities/attach/dd40edd4-d03e-4e85-af75-23a096edf6b0/1411-Galaxy-Fields.jpg)\n\n**1.** Cominciare facendo vedere agli studenti il video sulla Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) per imparare come le fibre ottiche vengono usate in combinazione con i telescopi per fare osservazioni di molti oggetti in una volta.\n\n**2.** Distribuire a tutti gli studenti delle stampe di \u201ccampi galattici\u201d e delle forbici. Il documento word allegato pu\u00f2 essere usato e modificato per fare diversi tipi di campi che includono stelle e galassie. Fare usare agli studenti le forbici per tagliare i buchi corrispondenti nel piatto di carta (in maniera simile a come gli scienziati fabbricano le lamine usate nella SDSS mostrate nel video che raccolgono la luce di stelle singole, in corrispondenza alle lamine con le fibre ottiche attaccate). Questo li aiuter\u00e0 a capire la difficolt\u00e0 di far corrispondere un campo di stelle alle lamine fabbricate della SDSS per la fibra ottica.\n\n**3.** Dopo aver tagliato tutte le \u201cgalassie\u201d e le \u201cstelle\u201d nel loro campo galattico, gli studenti dovrebbero osservare come sono distribuiti i buchi e vedere come la luce vi passa attraverso proprio come nelle lamine usate dalla SDSS. Discutere anche le difficolt\u00e0 di fare buchi precisi per ogni stella o galassia e quanta pi\u00f9 precisione e accuratezza bisogna porre per la SDSS nel fare questo processo per centinaia di galassie e stelle per ogni lamina che viene fabbricata.\n\n**4.** Successivamente, far passare le lunghezze di corde e nastro o gli steli di ciniglia, dire agli studenti di usare la corda/gli steli come se fossero le fibre ottiche usate dalla SDSS, collegandole ai buchi in modo che la luce che passa attraverso I buchi venga raccolta dalla fibra ottica singola per l\u2019osservazione.\n\n**5.** Chiedere agli studenti di discutere il ruolo della lamina e della corda/scovolini nella ricerca. In altre parole, capire se possono descrivere il processo della luce stellare che entra nel telescopio, passa attraverso la lamina verso le fibre ottiche e poi dentro lo spettrografo, quindi analizzata da esso per dare agli scienziati le informazioni.\n\n**6.** Concludere guardando il video YouTube video \u201cTools of Astronomy\u201d e discutere I diversi modi che abbiamo per osservare l\u2019universo e come ci sono molte tecniche diverse per usare la tecnologia per raggiungere diversi obiettivi. Per esempio, questo \u00e8 un buon punto di partenza per proseguire in ulteriori spiegazioni sulla spettroscopia e su come la luce pu\u00f2 essere usata per identificare la composizione di stelle e galassie.\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 3: Galaxy Zoo\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/dd40edd4-d03e-4e85-af75-23a096edf6b0/1411-galaxy-zoo.jpg)\n\n**1.** Un\u2019attivit\u00e0 ulteriore di follow-up per gli studenti, nel caso fossero disponibili dei computer, \u00e8 quella di introdurli al progetto Galaxy Zoo. Dovrebbe essere fatto notare agli studenti che il Galaxy Zoo non \u00e8 il risultato delle osservazioni dalla SDSS usando lo spettrografo multi-oggetto, ma solo un altro esempio di quanto siano utili le survey come questa per studiare l\u2019universo in una grande variet\u00e0 di modi, e quanto la luce pu\u00f2 dirci molte cose su un oggetto osservato.\n\n**2.** Dividere gli studenti in gruppi di lavoro (a seconda del numero di computer disponibili), andare al tutorial e al progetto di Galaxy Zoo per imparare come I dati della SDSS sono disponibili pubblicamente e sono stati sviluppati in un progetto di *citizen science* delle galassie per i cittadini.\n\n**3.** Incoraggiare gli studenti a partecipare alla *citizen science* e al galaxy zoo a casa, e ricordare tutto il duro lavoro che va nello sviluppo della tecnologia per raccogliere queste informazioni, oltre che il duro lavoro che va per la raccolta effettiva di queste informazioni.", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "- [The Astronomical Uses of Optical Fibers by Ian R.

Sono cos\u00ec distanti che li vediamo come puntini anche attraverso grandi telescopi, anche se sono grandi sfere di gas proprio come il Sole. Formano costellazioni, e alcune delle stelle pi\u00f9 luminose hanno un nome, per esempio Vega, Antares e Sirio. Alcune di esse hanno colori distinti, ma la maggior parte mostrano solo un accenno di colore.\nIl colore di una stella \u00e8 legato al suo tipo spettrale. Dal pi\u00f9 blu al pi\u00f9 rosso: O, B, A, F, G, K, e M.\nQuesta sequenza corrisponde fisicamente a quella della temperatura superficiale, dalla pi\u00f9 calda alla pi\u00f9 fredda. Il Sole \u00e8 una stella di tipo G, di colore bianco-giallo. Una stella color bianco puro \u00e8 detta di tipo A.\nI pianeti sono invece puntini luminosi \u201cvagabondi\u201d (vagano rispetto allo sfondo di stelle) e sono i fratelli della Terra. Anche se i pianeti sono molto pi\u00f9 piccoli delle stelle, sono abbastanza vicini da poter essere visti come dischi attraverso i nostri telescopi. Alcuni pianeti luminosi hanno colori distinti, e tale colore \u00e8 dovuto alla riflessione della luce del sole da parte del pianeta stesso.\n\n**Scintillio [Settori scientifici corrispondenti: Scintillio astronomico, composizione dell\u2019atmosfera]**\n\nUna delle ragioni che causano lo scintillio di stelle e pianeti \u00e8 l\u2019atmosfera terrestre. Diversi livelli di aria di indice di rifrazione leggermente diverso fluiscono attraverso l\u2019atmosfera. La luce delle stelle viene deflessa nell\u2019attraversamento dell\u2019atmosfera, causando lo scintillio. Visto che i pianeti appaiono come piccolo dischi nel nostro cielo, la luce deviata da ogni punto si combina, minimizzando lo scintillio, mentre le stelle, che sono puntini, scintillano di pi\u00f9 dei pianeti. La posizione del puntino luminoso della stella non solo si muove un po\u2019, ma anche il colore sembra cambiare lievemente, in particolare per le stelle bianche. Il grado di scintillio di una stella varia quotidianamente a seconda delle condizioni meteorologiche.\n\n**Movimento diurno [Settori scientifici corrispondenti: rotazione della Terra, sistema Sole-Terra]**\n\nTutte le stelle, i pianeti, il Sole e la Luna attraversano il cielo una volta al giorno. Questo movimento diurno apparente \u00e8 dovuto alla rotazione terrestre attorno al proprio asse, che compie un giro completo ogni giorno. Tutti i corpi celesti sorgono dall\u2019orizzonte orientale, culminano e tramontano verso l\u2019orizzonte occidentale, eccetto gli oggetti vicini alla stella Polare, la stella del Nord, che fa il giro attorno al polo nord celeste. Il movimento diurno \u00e8 lento, cos\u00ec quando l\u2019oggetto sta per tramontare, \u00e8 una buona opportunit\u00e0 per osservare il moto continuo che \u00e8 comune a tutti i corpi.\n\n**Il colore del cielo serale [Settori scientifici corrispondenti: Sistema Sole-Terra, composizione dell\u2019atmosfera, scattering della luce]**\n\nLa luce del sole che colpisce l\u2019atmosfera terrestre si disperde, colorando il cielo di un blu acceso durante il d\u00ec e di vari colori nel cielo serale.  I colori del cielo serale cambiano di giorno in giorno a seconda delle condizioni meteorologiche, e sono influenzati anche da piccole particelle presenti nell\u2019aria.\n\n**Prima stella [Settori scientifici corrispondenti: Sistema solare, stagioni, latitudine e longitudine, ora del giorno]**\n\nLa prima stella non \u00e8 una stella specifica o un pianeta. A volte potrebbe essere un pianeta come Venere o Giove, o una stella come Vega o Sirio. Per conoscere i nomi e le posizioni delle stelle e dei pianeti possono essere usati un planetario software come Stellarium o degli almanacchi. Il momento in cui arriva la notte ed \u00e8 visibile la prima stella dipende dalla stagione, dalla latitudine e dalla longitudine del sito di osservazione.\n\n**ATTENZIONE**: Guardare direttamente il Sole, anche se al tramonto, \u00e8 molto pericoloso per gli occhi.

Alla sera, nella stanza di un asilo nido, di una materna o di un istituto pre-scolastico.\n2. Alcuni studenti vengono tenuti delle ore extra dagli insegnanti, mentre aspettano i genitori.\n3. C\u2019\u00e8 bel tempo, e gli studenti possono vedere il cielo serale da una grande finestra.\n4. Nel cortile o nell\u2019area giochi sul tetto, a cielo aperto.\n5. Gli insegnanti potrebbero leggere dei libri agli studenti, cantare con loro, oppure potrebbero far vedere loro dei video prima che i genitori li vengano a prendere. \u00c8 una situazione accogliente, e c\u2019\u00e8 un tesoro naturale meraviglioso sia per gli studenti che per gli insegnanti: il cielo serale. Traete profitto da questo; non ci sono costi, n\u00e9 tempo extra per la preparazione, non c\u2019\u00e8 bisogno di un allestimento special, ed \u00e8 fruibile da tutte le persone in tutti I luoghi, anche nel centro di citt\u00e0 in cui c\u2019\u00e8 inquinamento luminoso.

Ce ne sono altri?\n- Risposta attesa: Giallo dorato, blu, blu scuro, grigio\u2026\n\nLo scambio di domande e risposte stimola ulteriori osservazioni. Anche gli insegnanti potrebbero notare una grande variet\u00e0 di colori. Trovare molti colori porta a un\u2019attivit\u00e0 di disegno pi\u00f9 ricca. Fare attenzione, poich\u00e9 la luce intensa del sole pi\u00f2 causare gravi danni agli occhi. Anche la luce delicate del Sole che sta tramontando potrebbe essere molto pericolosa se guardata direttamente. Il momento migliore per le osservazioni \u00e8 dopo il tramonto.\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 1.2 Colori del cielo serale in direzioni diverse**\n\nOsservazione: Cielo serale\n- Domanda: Il colore del cielo rimane lo stesso tutto il giorno?\n- Risposta attesa: \u00c8 rosso, arancione e giallo alla sera.\n- Domanda: Guardate sopra la vostra testa.\n- Risposta attesa: Ah, \u00e8 blu scuro!\n- Domanda: Guardate nella direzione opposta al sole.\n- Risposta attesa: Ah, \u00e8 un po\u2019 luminoso anche qui.\n- Domanda: Che colore \u00e8?\n- Risposta attesa: C\u2019\u00e8 un\u2019area un po\u2019 rosa.\n\nLo scambio di domande e risposte stimola ulteriori osservazioni.\nA differenza del cielo diurno, quello serale si differenzia molto dall\u2019orizzonte allo Zenith e da est a ovest. Sdraiandosi sul cortile si nota la variazione. Si pu\u00f2 notare una strana fascia rosa in orizzontale, parallela all\u2019orizzonte orientale. L\u2019area scura sotto il rosa appena sopra l\u2019orizzonte orientale \u00e8 l\u2019ombra della Terra che si proietta sull\u2019atmosfera terrestre. La fascia rosa \u00e8 il confine dell\u2019ombra della terra ed \u00e8 la proiezione del bagliore serale, ed \u00e8 chiamata Cintura di Venere.\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 1.3 Cambiamento dei colori nel cielo serale**\n\nOsservazione: Cielo serale\n- Domanda: Il colore del cielo sta cambiando?\n- Risposta attesa: S\u00ec.\n- Domanda: In che modo?\n- Risposta attesa: Il cielo sta diventando pi\u00f9 scuro, dal blu, al blu scuro, fino al nero. La zona gialla e arancione sta diminuendo.\n- Domanda: E per quanto riguarda l\u2019intero cielo?\n- Risposta attesa: L\u2019area luminosa si sta calando sempre di pi\u00f9.\n\nLo scambio di domande e risposte stimola ulteriori osservazioni.\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 1.4 Le forme e i colori delle nuvole serali**\n\nOsservazione: Cielo serale\n- Domanda: Scegliete le forme delle nuvole che preferite. A cosa assomigliano? \n- Risposta attesa: Un cane! Un gatto! Un dinosauro! Un drago! Un fantasma!\n\nAlcuni potrebbero essere animali veri o costruzioni e altri potrebbero essere immaginari.

Le loro forme cambiano!\n\nLo scambio di domande e risposte stimola ulteriori osservazioni. Ad alcuni studenti non interessa se le nuvole si muovono o cambiano forma, cos\u00ec spesso disegnano nuvole stereotipate come se fossero grazioso cotone sulla parte superiore del foglio. Non dire agli studenti semplicemente che le nuvole non sono ferme, ma incoraggiarli a notare che non lo sono.\nAlcuni studenti potranno dire che alcune nuvole sono nere. Questo non \u00e8 dovuto al loro colore reale, ma al fatto che la loro parte inferiore \u00e8 in ombra. Gli insegnanti possono spiegare questo fenomeno cos\u00ec: se l\u2019esterno \u00e8 luminoso e si spengono le luci della stanza, cosa succede alla cornice della finestra? Appare nera in confronto al paesaggio esterno, che \u00e8 luminoso, anche se il vero colore \u00e8 bianco (oppure un altro colore).\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 1.5 Il cambiamento della temperatura, del vento, del suono e dell\u2019atmosfera.**\n\nOsservazione: Temperatura, vento, suono\n- Domanda: Percepite qualcosa di diverso di sera?\n- Risposta attesa: Diventa buio.\n- Domanda: \u00c8 tutto ci\u00f2 che sentite?

Il vento diventa pi\u00f9 forte e la sua direzione pu\u00f2 cambiare.\n\nLo scambio di domande e risposte stimola ulteriori osservazioni. Lasciare che gli studenti pensino che un fenomeno astronomico come il sole che tramonta ha un grande impatto sulla vita quotidiana.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/fb5749c1-8953-4336-86c5-551cf9518275/astroedu1616_evening_sky.jpg)\nNel cielo serale ci sono puntini di luce che non sono stelle. Alcune nuvole e costruzioni appaiono nere, a causa dell\u2019ombra, nascondendo i loro veri colori.\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 2: Prima stella\n**Attivit\u00e0 2.1 Individuare la prima stella**\n\nOsservazione: prima stella\n- Domanda: Si sta facendo buio. Cercate e trovate la prima stella.\n- Risposta attesa: Eccola!\n\nLa visione degli studenti \u00e8 migliore di quella degli adulti, specie la sera. Anche se un insegnante di astronomia sa dove spunter\u00e0 la prima stella, gli studenti possono vincere.\n\n- Domanda: (Anche se una bimba o un bimbo riesce a trovare la prima stella in fretta, altri potrebbero non riuscirci). Lei (o lui) l\u2019ha trovata! (Ad un altro studente) Non ancora? Spiegate la posizione.\n- Risposta attesa: Sopra quell\u2019albero. Alla sinistra del lampione. \u2013 No! \u2013 Due pugni sopra quell\u2019albero, appena a sinistra del lampione, proprio sul bordo della nuvola a forma di cane. \u2013 S\u00ec, l\u00e0!\n\nIncoraggiare gli studenti a spiegare la posizione della prima stella indicando altri oggetti e le distanze da essi. Alcuni studenti potrebbero chiedere i nomi delle stelle. Comunque, non \u00e8 necessario ricordarseli. Osservare le stelle che spuntano, i loro colori e spiegare chiaramente \u00e8 pi\u00f9 importante per gli studenti al fine di migliorare le abilit\u00e0 scientifiche, rispetto a conoscere solo i nomi. Quindi, incoraggiare gli studenti a notare attentamente la posizione delle stelle, il colore, e altre caratteristiche. D\u2019altra parte, imparare il nome di una stella in anticipo \u00e8 un\u2019ottima cosa per la sicurezza dell\u2019insegnante. Software come Stellarium sono molto utili per imparare l\u2019ora del tramonto, la durata del crepuscolo e i nomi delle stelle brillanti relative al luogo, alla latitudine, alla longitudine e alla data. Il software simula anche come spuntano la prima stella e diverse altre.\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 2.2 Individuare la seconda e la terza stella**\n\nOsservazione: alcune stelle luminose\n- Domanda: Avete tutti gi\u00e0 trovato la prima stella?\n- Risposta attesa: S\u00ec!\n- Domanda: Dov\u2019\u00e8?\n- Risposta attesa: L\u00ec! (La indicano con un dito)\n- Domanda: Mm? Alcuni stanno indicando l\u00e0 e altri stanno indicando da un\u2019altra parte. Ci sono \u201cmolte\u201d prime stelle?\n- Risposta attesa: \u00c8 questa la prima stella! \u2013 No, \u00e8 quella! \u2013 S\u00ec, lo credo anche io! \u2013 No, non \u00e8 vero!\n\nQuando gli studenti trovano la prima stella, \u00e8 gi\u00e0 molto buio. Quando la seconda, la terza e molte pi\u00f9 stelle escono fuori, noteranno quante stelle ci sono nel cielo serale anche in un\u2019area urbana. Non ci si aspetta di vedere un cielo pieno di stelle in un\u2019area urbana, ma diversi puntini luminosi bastano a far capire agli studenti che esiste un vero cielo stellato nella loro vita quotidiana.\n\n- Domanda: Ok, riuscite a contare quante stelle ci sono?\n- Risposta attesa: S\u00ec! Una, due\u2026\n\nPer studenti molto piccoli, contare oltre al dieci potrebbe essere molto difficile, ma se c\u2019\u00e8 bisogno di contare, abbiamo bisogno di grandi numeri. Non abbiamo intenzione di fargli imparare la matematica troppo presto. Dobbiamo contare, quindi abbiamo bisogno di grandi numeri, e agli studenti piace usarli.\n\n- Domanda: Ora, come si possono riconoscere stelle che non siano aerei o elicotteri?\n- Risposta attesa: Le stelle brillano fisse. Gli aerei lampeggiano. I satelliti artificiali illuminano pi\u00f9 intensamente o debolmente. / Le stelle non si muovono, gli aeroplani s\u00ec. I satelliti artificiali si muovono velocemente. / Il colore \u00e8 diverso (le stelle non sono colorate)./ Le stelle non producono un suono.\n\nBasandosi su ci\u00f2 che vedono nella vita quotidiana, gli studenti possono distinguere con successo le stelle dagli altri oggetti. Qui \u00e8 importante lasciare che spieghino le ragioni. Gli studenti proveranno a spiegarsi usando parole o gesti.\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/fb5749c1-8953-4336-86c5-551cf9518275/astroedu1616_planet_venus.jpg)\nQuesto \u00e8 un esempio della prima stella, il pianeta Venere con alcune nuvole piccole e strane.\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 3: Stelle\n**Attivit\u00e0 3.1 I colori delle stelle**\n\nOsservazione: Alcune stelle luminose\n- Domanda: Riuscite a notare i colori delle stelle?\n- Risposta attesa: \u2026No. / Colori?\n-- Domanda: Potreste pensare che molte stelle siano bianche. Ma qui c\u2019\u00e8 un accenno di colore, un po\u2019 di rosso, un pu\u00f2 di blu. Riuscite a vederlo?\n- Risposta attesa: S\u00ec, vedo un po\u2019 di rosso\u2026/ Un po\u2019 di blu!\n\nIl botta e risposta stimola ulteriori osservazioni. Il colore di una stella \u00e8 impercettibile. Non ci sono stelle che siano di un blu puro o di un rosso puro. In pratica sono bianche con un accenno di rosso, arancione, giallo o blu. La capacit\u00e0 visiva umana fa fatica a distinguere i colori di oggetti poco luminosi. Se usiamo binocoli o telescopi e raccogliamo un sacco di luce, possiamo apprezzare una grande variet\u00e0 di colori nelle stelle, ma soltanto a occhio nudo, solo le stelle pi\u00f9 luminose mostrano qualche colore. I libri di scienze presentano i colori delle stelle, e alcuni dei progetti dei planetari esagerano i colori, ma la verit\u00e0 \u00e8 che il colore delle stelle \u00e8 impercettibile e non facile da vedere.\n\n- Domanda: Quella stella \u00e8 arancione? Sicuri? Quella stella \u00e8 bianca e senza colore? Sicuri? Guardate di nuovo attentamente. \n- Risposta attesa: Wow, i colori cambiano! Giallo? No! Ora \u00e8 blu\u2026 No! Non riesco a capire di che colore \u00e8!\n\nLo scambio di domande e risposte stimola ulteriori osservazioni. A causa dell\u2019atmosfera terrestre, le stelle scintillano. Questo causa anche uno sfarfallio di colori che cambiano. I migliori esempi sono Vega in estate e Sirio in inverno. Entrambe sono stelle di classe spettrale A, e il colore che ci aspettiamo \u00e8 bianco puro. Tuttavia, attraverso lo scintillio, i colori sembrano cambiare da rosso, giallo e da blu a bianco. Si apprezzi lo sfarfallio di colori e quello di luce. Lo sfarfallio del colore non pu\u00f2 essere simulato nella cupola di un planetario. \u00c8 una caratteristica della reale luce naturale delle stelle.\n\n**Attivit\u00e0 3.2 Il movimento di una stella**\n\nOsservazione: Alcune stelle, specialmente una stella luminosa che tramonta o un pianeta\n- Domanda: Le stelle tramontano?\n- Risposta attesa: No! Le stelle fluttuano\n- Domanda: Il Sole tramonta?\n- Risposta attesa: S\u00ec.\n- Domanda: Perch\u00e9 lo pensate?\n- Risposta attesa: L\u2019ho visto.\n- Domanda: Bene. Quindi, la Luna tramonta?\n- Risposta attesa: S\u00ec, l\u2019ho vista.\n- Domanda: Bene. Allora, perch\u00e9 pensate che le stelle non tramontino?\n- Risposta attesa: Non le ho viste farlo. Le stelle spuntano e fluttuano nella notte.\n\nQuesto \u00e8 un tipico botta e risposta di un bambino di 4 o 5 anni.\nLa risposta \u201cS\u00ec\u201d o \u201cNo\u201d \u00e8 basata in ci\u00f2 che hanno visto nella loro vita quotidiana. \u00c8 l\u2019atteggiamento mentale tipico dello scienziato. La maggior parte degli studenti non hanno mai visto le stelle tramontare o sorgere, e la situazione \u00e8 la stessa per la maggior parte degli adulti.\n\n- Domanda: Sapete che c\u2019\u00e8 una stella luminosa nel crepuscolo serale?

Questa distanza \u00e8 tale che la temperatura media in superficie \u00e9 al di sopra del punto di congelamento dell\u2019acqua (0\u00b0C) e l\u2019acqua pu\u00f2 esistere allo stato liquido. Ci\u00f2 ha avuto un ruolo fondamentale nello sviluppo della Vita sul nostro pianeta, diversamente da ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 accaduto su Venere e Marte, le cui temperature superficiali sono molto pi\u00f9 alte oppure molto pi\u00f9 basse. La forma della Terra \u00e8 quasi perfettamente sferica. A causa della sua lenta rotazione \u2014 ogni 24 ore \u2014 le distorsioni sono minime, e la differenza tra il raggio equatoriale (6,378 km) e il raggio polare (6,357 km) \u00e9 di solo 21 km. La Terra ha un unico satellite naturale, la Luna, che si pensa abbia avuto un ruolo importante nella stabilizzazione dell\u2019asse di rotazione della Terra. Di nuovo, questo pu\u00f2 essere stato un elemento positivo per la comparsa della vita.\n\n**Caratteristiche Tattili**\n(mentre esplori il modello schematico tattile)\n\n![](/media/activities/attach/9271e124-6a1a-4bed-a650-ad104b9972e6/1406_tactile_earth.jpg)\n\n**Oceani, continenti e calotte polari**\n\nSulla Terra, il 71% della superficie \u00e9 ricoperto dall\u2019acqua (rappresentata dalla plastica nell\u2019mmagine tattile), quindi l\u2019area occupata da mari ed oceani \u00e9 pari a pi\u00f9 del doppio di quella  occupata dalla terra. La distribuzione di terre e mari \u00e9 ineguale e peculiare: infatti la maggioranza delle terre si trovano nell\u2019emisfero settentrionale, nei tre continenti pi\u00f9 grandi: Europa, Asia, e Nord America ( nel modello tattile i continenti sono rappresentati dal tessuto verde). Anche i poli della Terra sono differenti tra di loro: al Polo Sud c\u2019\u00e8 un continente ricoperto di ghiacci (Antartide), mentre al Polo Nord c\u2019\u00e8 un oceano (il Mar Glaciale Artico), che d\u2019inverno forma  la calotta polare (nel modello tattile entrambi i poli sono rappresentati dal foglio di alluminio). Sulla Terra, le alture vengono  misurate  rispetto al livello medio del mare mean. Esse variano da un\u2019altezza di 8,848 metri (Monte Everest) e una profondit\u00e0 di 11,000 metri (Fossa delle Marianne nel settore nord-occidentale dell\u2019Oceano Pacifico). La profondit\u00e0 media degli oceani \u00e8 di 3,800 metri, e l\u2019altitudine media della terra \u00e8 di 840 metri.\n\n**Nuvole ed uragani**\n\nLa Terra ha un\u2019atmosfera relativamente sottile, che si estende per meno di 200 km di altezza. L\u2019aria secca \u00e9 is composta soprattutto da azoto (N2: 78.08%), ossigeno (O2: 20.95%), ed argon (Ar: 0.93%). Il rimanente 0.04% \u00e9  un misto di  \u201ctracce\u201d di gas, soprattutto anidride carbonica (CO2), ma anche gas rari, come il neon (Ne), l\u2019elio (He), e il krypton (Kr). In linea di massima, il vapore acqueo (H2O) costituisce lo 0.25% della massa dell\u2019atmosfera, ma la sua concentrazione varia parecchio, a seconda della temperatura locale: pu\u00f2 passare da un minimo dello 0.01% ad un massimo del 5%. Quando sale nella parte superiore dell\u2019atmosfera (in media al di sopra dei 3000 metri), il vapore acqueo si condensa per formare le nuvole di diversa densit\u00e0 e forma (rappresentate da ciuffetti di cotone nel modello tattile); alcune di queste nuvole possono accumularsi fino a formare poderosi uragani al di sopra degli oceani (rappresentati da filo di ferro attorcigliato nel modello tattile). Recentemente il clima terrestre ha attraversato una fase di riscaldamento senza precedenti, dovuto all\u2019azione dei gas che provocano  \u201cl\u2019effetto serra\u201d, come l\u2019anidride carbonica e il metano, che gli esseri umani hanno continuato a diffondere abbondantemente, fin dall\u2019inizio dell\u2019era industriale. Questi gas tendono ad intrappolare la  radiazione infrarossa proveniente dalla superficie della Terra, causando il riscaldamento di quest\u2019ultima; questo fenomeno viene appunto definito \"effetto serra.\"", "fulldesc": "#### Prima dell\u2019attivit\u00e0:\n- Stampate una copia delle schede in pdf con la forma e le caratteristiche della Terra per ogni gruppo, w preparate i materiali elencati sopra.\n- Chiedete agli studenti cosa sanno della Terra, e qual\u2019\u00e8 l\u2019aspetto della Terra dallo Spazio.

Questo \u00e8 anche uno dei maggiori obiettivi delle esplorazioni spaziali nel Sistema Solare, ad esempio verso Marte.\n\nLa presenza di acqua liquida dipende dalle condizioni dell'ambiente, come la temperatura dell'aria e la pressione atmosferica. Il fattore principale che determina la temperatura superficiale di un pianeta \u00e8 la sua distanza dalla stella centrale attorno a cui orbita. Le temperature sono accettabili solo in una piccola finestra nella quale l'acqua non evapora completamente o non si ghiaccia. Queste condizioni sono modificate da influenze locali come la densit\u00e0 dell'atmosfera e la composizione dei potenziali gas serra. \nQuesto definisce un *range* nel quale, data una determinata stella, \u00e8 possibile che sia presente acqua liquida. Questo *range* \u00e8 definito 'zona abitabile'. Se un pianeta viene trovato in questa zona, potrebbe avere acqua in forma liquida e quindi ospitare forme di vita simili a quella che conosciamo. Nel Sistema Solare, la Terra occupa la zona abitabile. Alcuni modelli ritengono che anche Marte faccia parte di questa zona. \n\nNon esiste nessuna garanzia che un pianeta che orbiti nella zona abitabile necessariamente possieda quantit\u00e0 considerevoli di acqua liquida oppure ospiti qualche tipo di vita, poich\u00e9 le condizioni su ogni pianeta possono essere notevolmente differenti. Altre condizioni al contorno che potrebbero aiutare lo sviluppo di forme di vita sono le fonti di energia (fonti luminose o chimiche) e il campo magnetico che protegge dalla radiazione di particelle ionizzanti.\n\n**Marte ospita o ha ospitato la vita?**  \n\nMarte \u00e8 grande la met\u00e0 della Terra. Il suo colore rosso \u00e8 causato dalla presenza di ossido di ferro (ruggine), e ha un'atmosfera molto sottile e rarefatta, che \u00e8 composta principalmente da diossido di carbonio (anidride carbonica). Una delle principali caratteristiche del pianeta \u00e8 la presenza di molti vulcani estinti, che raggiungono altezze anche superiori ai 22000 metri! Come la Terra, anche su Marte ci sono le stagioni poich\u00e9 il suo asse \u00e8 inclinato. In teoria, considerando la zona abitabile del Sistema Solare, Marte potrebbe ospitare la vita. \n\nAd oggi, non ci sono indicazioni per dire se Marte \u00e8 abitato o lo \u00e8 stato in passato. Comunque, ci sono forti evidenze che sulla superficie del pianeta sia esistita acqua in forma liquida per molto tempo.\nLa spiegazione pi\u00f9 comune del suo stato attuale \u00e8 che Marte ha perso buona parte dell'atmosfera e per questo motivo anche molta dell'acqua presente sulla sua superficie \u00e8 evaporata nello spazio, rimanendo per\u00f2 presente sotto forma di ghiaccio in depositi che si trovano sotto la superficie.  (nota: sarebbe da aggiornare date le ultime scoperte http://www.media.inaf.it/2018/07/25/marte-acqua-lago/)\nMarte \u00e8 abbastanza piccolo, per questo la sua forza gravitazionale \u00e8 piuttosto bassa;  perci\u00f2 il pianeta fatica a trattenere l'atmosfera. Inoltre, in mancanza del campo magnetico il vento solare riesce facilmente a sottrarre molecole all'atmosfera marziana. Comunque ci sono evidenze che almeno per un periodo di tempo e almeno in alcune regioni l'acqua liquida sia stata presente anche in superficie. L'elevata salinit\u00e0 aiuta a mantenere l'acqua liquida nonostante le temperature siano al di sotto del punto di solidificazione dell'acqua pura. (vedi Articolo 1 allegato all'attivit\u00e0).\n\nGli scienziati sperano che alcune forme di vita possano essere sopravvissute negli strati di ghiaccio presenti sulla superficie di Marte. Il programma spaziale europeo ExoMars, che verr\u00e0 lanciato nel 2020, servir\u00e0 per validare questa ipotesi usando un laboratorio robotico. La strumentazione sar\u00e0 in grado di scavare la superficie marziana per indagarne l'attivit\u00e0 chimica e biologica.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/ExoMars_Rover_annotated_front_20170418.jpg)\n**Figura 1**: Modello del rover ExoMars che sar\u00e0 lanciato nel 2020 (ESA/ATG medialab, [http://exploration.esa.int/](http://exploration.esa.int/mars/58885-exomars-rover-front-view-annotated/), [ESA Copyright Notice Images](http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/ESA_Multimedia/Copyright_Notice_Images)).\n\n**Altri luoghi all'interno del Sistema Solare**  \nNegli ultimi anni, gli scienziati stanno portando avanti l'idea che ci sono altri luoghi nel Sistema Solare che potrebbero essere abitabili nonostante non siano all'interno della zona abitabile. In particolare Europa ed Encelado, lune ghiacciate rispettivamente dei pianeti gassosi Giove e Saturno, sono molto interessanti da questo punto di vista. Le osservazioni fatte durante le missioni spaziali di esplorazione del Sistema Solare, come la sonda Cassini, hanno trovato indirizzi della presenza di oceani di acqua liquida sotto la spessa superficie ghiacciata (vedi Articolo 2 allegato a questa attivit\u00e0). C'\u00e8 una forte evidenza che ci sono camini idrotermali negli oceani sotto la superficie di Encelado (vedi Articolo 3 allegato a questa attivit\u00e0). \nLe stesse sorgenti si ritrovano anche nelle profondit\u00e0 marine della Terra. In corrispondenza di tali punti si trovano colonie di forme di vita che si nutrono dell'idrogeno che fuoriesce da questi camini. (nota: strano che si nutrano di idrogeno.)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/main_pia11688.jpg)\n**Figura 2**: Getti di acqua ghiacciata e vapore dalla regione sud-polare della luna di Saturno Encelado. La prima rilevazione di questi getti \u00e8 arrivata dalla sonda Cassini durante il primo flyby della luna ghiacciata avvenuto il 17 febbraio 2005. (NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute,  [https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11688](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11688)).\n\n**Una formula semplice per la zona abitabile**  \n\u00c8 possibile calcolare a quale distanza da una determinata stella in cui le condizioni sono confrontabili a quelle della Terra, intesa come modello di pianeta abitabile. La distanza della zona abitabile risulta proporzionale alla luminosit\u00e0 della stella. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Picture1.png)\n\nQui, L<sub>*</sub> \u00e8 la luminosit\u00e0 dell stella e L<sub>\u2299</sub> \u00e8 la luminosit\u00e0 del Sole. \nLa distanza d<sub>HZ</sub> pu\u00f2 quindi indicare la posizione della zona abitabile. \nLa sua estensione dipende da quali temperature ci si aspetta di trovare al suo confine interno e al suo confine esterno.\nEsistono modelli predittivi di abitabilit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 complessi che includono anche le propriet\u00e0 dei pianeti come la presenza e la composizione dell'atmosfera e la massa. In ogni caso, la zona abitabile \u00e8 un range di distanze non ben definito all'interno di un sistema planetario, perch\u00e9 dipende da moltissime propriet\u00e0 che permettono all'acqua di essere presente in forma liquida. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Solarsystemau_habit.jpg)\n**Figura 3**: Distanze delle zone abitabili per stelle di varie luminosit\u00e0.

Questo pianeta, chiamato 51 Pegasi b, non assomiglia alla Terra. Esso orbita attorno alla propria stella a una distanza di appena 0,05 UA, cio\u00e8 il 5% della distanza media tra la Terra e il Sole. Per confronto, il pianeta pi\u00f9 vicino al Sole, Mercurio, orbita a una distanza di 0,5 UA, cio\u00e8 10 volte pi\u00f9 lontano di 51 Pegasi b rispetto alla sua stella. Inoltre, questo pianeta \u00e8 un gigante gassoso simile a Giove o Saturno. Ad oggi (luglio 2017), conosciamo 3627 esopianeti, dei quali 2718 appartengono a sistemi planetari (vedi [http://www.exoplanets.eu](http://www.exoplanets.eu/)).\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/HabitableZone.jpg)\n**Figura 4**: Le zone abitabili circumstellari di tre stelle con diversa massa, luminosit\u00e0 e temperatura superficiale. (NASA/Kepler Mission/D. Berry, [http://aasnova.org/2016/02/24/where-to-look-for-habitability/](http://aasnova.org/2016/02/24/where-to-look-for-habitability/)).\n\nLa Figura 4 mostra la zona abitabile circumstellare (in verde) per stelle con temperature e luminosit\u00e0 differenti. La stella centrale corrisponde a stelle simili al Sole. Le stelle pi\u00f9 calde solitamente hanno una zona abitabile pi\u00f9 estesa, mentre quelle pi\u00f9 fredde hanno hanno zone abitabili meno estese. Nell'area blu le temperature sono troppo basse perch\u00e9 l'acqua possa essere allo stato liquido, mentre nell'area rossa le temperature sono troppo alte. \n\nLa Figura 5 mostra un esempio di esopianeta in orbita attorno alla stella HD33793, anche conosciuta come la stella di Kapteyn. La stella ha una temperatura superficiale di 3570 K, che \u00e8 circa met\u00e0 della temperatura superficiale del Sole, ovvero 5778 K. Quindi, la zona abitabile (in verde) \u00e8 collocata a una distanza compresa tra 0,11 e 0,22 UA.\n\nA causa della bassa luminosit\u00e0 di questa stella, la zona abitabile \u00e8 meno estesa rispetto a quella del Sole. Comparando le zone abitabili del Sole e di HD 33793 (Figura 6) si trovano differenze sostanziali. La zona abitabile del Sole risulta pi\u00f9 estesa e pi\u00f9 distante. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/hec_orbit_Kapteyn_b.png)\n**Figura 5**: La zona abitabile (in verde) attorno alla stella HD 33793.

Per questo motivo \u00e8 importante che la radiazione che riceve dalla sua stella sia adeguata a mantenere le temperature al di sopra del valore che permette all'acqua di rimanere allo stato liquido. \n \nA causa di questa caratteristica per cui un pianeta potenzialmente abitabile riceve calore da una stella alla giusta distanza, questo pianeta pu\u00f2 essere visto come una macchina della vita il cui motore ha bisogno della giusta potenza per essere messo in moto. \n\nIntrodurre l'argomento facendo domande sul Sistema Solare (pianeti e composizione) e dove in esso la vita si \u00e8 evoluta. In alternativa, cominciare una discussione sulle condizioni necessarie a sostenere la vita su pianeti diversi dalla Terra (come Venere o Marte).\n\n**Domanda 1**:  C'\u00e8 vita su Marte?   \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  Non abbiamo trovato alcuna prova della sua presenza. \n\n**Domanda 2**:  C'\u00e8 acqua liquida su Marte?  \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  Molto poca. Perlomeno non cos\u00ec tanta da potersi aspettare mari, laghi e fiumi. \n\n**Domanda 3**:  Perch\u00e8 le due cose sono correlate?  \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  L'acqua \u00e8 il fattore chiave per la vita. Senza di essa, la vita per come la conosciamo non \u00e8 possibile.\n\nChiedere agli studenti se hanno sentito parlare di pianeti in orbita attorno ad altre stelle che non siano il Sole. \n\n**Domanda 4**:  Cosa serve per mantenere la vita su altri pianeti?  \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  Ci sono alcune condizioni che favoriscono la formazione e il mantenimento della vita, ma quella fondamentale \u00e8 ancora una volta l'acqua. Il calore serve soltanto per mantenere l'acqua allo stato liquido, almeno in alcune zone del pianeta. \nLe altre condizioni utili allo sviluppo della vita sono le fonti di energia (luminosa, chimica) o il campo magnetico che protegga dalla radiazione di particelle ionizzanti. Quest'ultima condizione non \u00e8 rilevante se la vita si sviluppa negli oceani.  \n\n**Domanda 5**:  Quali condizioni sono necessarie per mantenere l'acqua allo stato liquido?  \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  Calore, e in alcuni casi, la presenza di sali. Questi abbassano la temperatura di fusione dell'acqua. \n\n**Domanda 6**: Cosa fornisce alla Terra e agli altri pianeti il calore necessario per mantenere l'acqua liquida?  \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  Le stelle, in particolare il Sole nel nostro sistema solare. L'effetto serra generato nell'atmosfera aiuta a innalzare le temperature.\n\n**Domanda 7**:  Cosa succede all'acqua quando fa troppo freddo o troppo caldo?  \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  L'acqua ghiaccia o bolle ed evapora (nota: nella risposta e in generale nell'attivit\u00e0 non si tiene mai conto della pressione. Dato che \u00e8 anch'esso un fattore importante si potrebbe aggiungere una postilla). \n\nIl seguente esperimento \u00e8 una semplice analogia in cui la stella \u00e8 rappresentata da una lampada e il pianeta da celle fotovoltaiche collegate a un motore.\n\n### Attivit\u00e0 1: La macchina della vita\n\nMateriale :\n- proiettore, lampada potente\n- *Dimmer* per regolare la luminosit\u00e0\n- metro\n- celle fotovoltaiche collegate a un motore elettrico o una ventola (assicurarsi che la potenza generata dalle celle sia adeguata per azionare il motore)\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/SolarCell_ConnectionFan.jpg)\n**Figura 7**: La figura mostra le saldature tra la cella fotovoltaica e una ventola per computer. Qui, le connessioni possono essere interrotte attraverso micro plugs. La polarit\u00e0 \u00e8 indicata accanto ai punti di saldatura delle celle fotovoltaiche. (M. Nielbock).\n\n**Preparazione dell'esperimento**\n\n1.  Saldare il motore alle celle fotovoltaiche. Di solito questo passaggio risulta molto semplice. Le celle hanno dei punti in cui \u00e8 possibile saldare, con le polarit\u00e0 indicate. Si devono quindi soltanto usare i cavi (generalmente attaccati al motore) e unirli ai corrispettivi poli elettrici delle celle (vedi Figura 7).\n2. Un disco di cartone colorato attaccato all'asse di rotazione del motore permetter\u00e0 la visualizzazione della velocit\u00e0 del motore mentre \u00e8 in moto. Se si usa una ventola, si potrebbero colorare le pale. \n3. Inserire la lampada nel *dimmer* e il *dimmer* nella presa di corrente. \n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/ExperimentalSetup.png)\n**Figura 8**: Preparazione dell'esperimento (M. T\u00fcrk).\n\n**Domanda 8**:  In che modo si comporter\u00e0 il motore se le celle fotovoltaiche vengono messe a differenti distanze dalla lampada?  \n**Risposta che ci si aspetta dalla discussione**:  La velocit\u00e0 di rotazione dipende dalla distanza, in particolare pi\u00f9 lontano=pi\u00f9 lento, pi\u00f9 vicino=pi\u00f9 veloce. \n\n**Procedura sperimentale**\n\n1.  Accendere la lampada.\n2.  Posizionare le cellule fotovoltaiche lontano dalla lampada. Il motore deve essere fermo.\n3.  spostarle pi\u00f9 vicino alla lampada e determinare la distanza alla quale il motore comincia a funzionare.\n4.  Ripetere la procedura con diverse luminosit\u00e0 della lampada usando il dimmer.\n\n**Compiti**  \n1. Scrivere le proprie osservazioni. Descrivere i risultati ottenuti al variare della luminosit\u00e0 della lampada.  \n**Risultati attesi**:  La distanza necessaria per attivare il motore elettrico \u00e8 pi\u00f9 piccola con la lampada a luminosit\u00e0 inferiore rispetto alla lampada a luminosit\u00e0 superiore.  \n2. Si pu\u00f2 confrontare questo esperimento con la configurazione del Sistema Solare e le condizioni della sostenibilit\u00e0 della vita (rappresentata dal movimento del motore), poich\u00e9 la Terra (rappresentata dalle stelle fotovoltaiche) \u00e8 abbastanza vicina al Sole (rappresentato dalla lampada). Il punto nel quale il motore inizia a muoversi \u00e8 il contorno pi\u00f9 esterno della zona abitabile. Cosa ci dice l'esperimento rispetto agli esopianeti che potrebbero ospitare la vita in altri sistemi planetari con stelle diverse dal sole?  \n**Risultati attesi**: Un pianeta in un sistema planetario con una stella che \u00e8 meno luminosa del Sole deve essere pi\u00f9 vicino alla stella per poter essere nella zona abitabile.  \n\nPer ragazzi con pi\u00f9 di 14 anni:  \n3. Cosa succede al motore quando le celle fotovoltaiche sono molto vicine alla lampada?  \n**Risultati attesi**: Ruota molto velocemente. Si surriscalda.  \n4. Possiamo aspettarci che un pianeta ospiti la vita a qualsiasi distanza all'interno della zona abitabile?  \n**Risultati attesi**: No, poich\u00e9 quando la distanza decresce il pianeta riceve una radiazione troppo elevata. Questo comporta l'incremento del riscaldamento del pianeta. Se la temperatura \u00e8 troppo elevata l'acqua non pu\u00f2 esistere in forma liquida. \n\nL'attivit\u00e0 fornisce un'impressione qualitativa della natura e del principio basilare della zona abitabile. Ma come si presenta in realt\u00e0 la zona abitabile? La prossima attivit\u00e0 porta un esempio simile alla ricerca scientifica.

Arrotondare i valori al millimetro.\n\nIl modello mostrer\u00e0 il sistema planetario visto dall'alto. Usare il compasso per tracciare le orbite circolari scalate attorno alla posizione assunta per la stella Kepler-62.\n\nSuccessivamente, si dovr\u00e0 aggiungere la zona abitabile. In prima approssimazione, si pu\u00f2 applicare questa semplice equazione:\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Picture1.png)\n\nche dipende soltanto dalla luminosit\u00e0 della stella. Questa equazione indica a che distanza deve essere posizionato un pianeta simile alla Terra attorno a una stella simile al Sole di luminosit\u00e0 minore. Si usi la Tabella 1 per calcolare la distanza della zona abitabile di Kepler-62. Si noti che la distanza della zona abitabile \u00e8 proporzionale alla radice quadrata della luminosit\u00e0 della stella.\n\n**Domanda**: Usando questa semplice relazione, dove si pu\u00f2 trovare la zona abitabile di una stella in riferimento al sistema solare se la la stella ha quattro volte la luminosit\u00e0 del Sole?  \n**Risposta**: Si trover\u00e0 a distanza doppia se confrontata con la zona abitabile intorno al Sole.\n\nCalcolare precisamente i confini della zona abitabile \u00e8 difficile e necessita di modelli sofisticati. \u00e8 possibile trovare un tool on line a [questo link](http://depts.washington.edu/naivpl/sites/default/files/hz.shtml)\nche calcola la zona abitabile a partire dalla luminosit\u00e0 e dalla temperatura superficiale della stella. (questo passaggio pu\u00f2 essere fatto dall'insegnante invece che dare a ogni studente l'accesso a un computer). La sola cosa necessaria \u00e8 inserire la temperatura superficiale (Teff) e la luminosit\u00e0 della stella nei primi campi in alto, come mostrato in Figura 11.\nSi noti che, dopo aver inserito il valore nel *box*, \u00e8 necessario cliccare ancora nel riquadro per confermarlo ed evitare la sua cancellazione.\n\n![](http://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/50f56fc3-06c1-494d-a4c9-26b29cda3bc1/Fig 11.png)\n**Figura 11**: *Screenshot* del [*tool online*](http://depts.washington.edu/naivpl/sites/default/files/hz.shtml) per calcolare le dimensioni della zona abitabile.

In che modo i due approcci differiscono?  (Suggerimento: Se gli studenti hanno difficolt\u00e0 con la risposta, far loro usare il link on line facendo loro usare la temperatura superficiale del Sole invece che la luminosit\u00e0 stellare.)  \n**Risposta**: L'approccio semplice non tiene conto della temperatura superficiale della stella.\n\n**Domanda** (probabilmente pi\u00f9 adatta solo per le classi pi\u00f9 avanzate): In che modo il parametro mancante (temperatura superficiale) influenza la radiazione caratteristica di Kepler-62?  \n**Risposta**: Temperature minori significano spettri pi\u00f9 rossi. Lo spettro di Kepler-62 contiene una quantit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 elevata di radiazione infrarossa rispetto al Sole. Per questo motivo il riscaldamento delle atmosfere planetarie risulta pi\u00f9 efficiente. \n\nOra aggiungere il bordo interno ed esterno della zona abitabile sul modello in scala del sistema planetario. \n\u00e8 possibile colorare la zona abitabile.

Negli oggetti magnetici gli elettroni, almeno la maggior parte, ruotano nella stessa direzione attorno al nucleo. Questo \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che rende gli oggetti dei magneti.\nIn ciascun oggetto magnetico ci sono diversi gruppi di atomi. Ciascun gruppo forma il suo dominio. I domini magnetici che puntano in direzioni opposte si cancellano a vicenda. Dall\u2019altra parte, pi\u00f9 i domini sono allineati tra loro (ovvero puntano nella stessa direzione), pi\u00f9 il campo magnetico risulter\u00e0 forte. Nei magneti, tutti o la maggior parte dei domini puntano nella stessa direzione e si combinano per creare un unico grande campo magnetico.\nTutti i magneti hanno un polo sud e un polo nord; questo \u00e8 dovuto all\u2019allineamento dei domini. Poli opposti si attraggono tra loro e poli uguali si respingono.\nI magneti possono essere naturali o indotti. I magneti che creano il loro campo magnetico per tutto il tempo sono chiamati permanenti o magneti \"duri\". I magneti temporanei o magneti \"morbidi\" creano un campo magnetico per un breve periodo di tempo, dopo essere stati immersi in un altro campo magnetico.\nIl magnete naturale pi\u00f9 forte \u00e8 la magnetite. Se si strofina ripetutamente la magnetite su un pezzo di ferro in una direzione, anche il ferro si magnetizza (questo \u00e8 il metodo con cui si creano le bussole). \u00c8 essenzialmente lo stesso procedimento che si user\u00e0 in questa esperienza per magnetizzare il neodimio.\n\n####Gravit\u00e0:\nLa gravit\u00e0 \u00e8 la forza che attrae tutti gli oggetti tra loro.

La ragione per cui agli astronauti nello spazio sembra di galleggiare \u00e8 leggermente complesso: gli astronauti sperimentano la gravit\u00e0 quando orbitano attorno alla Terra o alla Luna. Tuttavia, dal momento che stanno orbitando attorno ad un pianeta, cadono costantemente verso il pianeta (come se cadessero gi\u00f9 da un palazzo ma non raggiungessero mai terra). Quando si \u00e8 in caduta libera sembra che non ci sia la gravit\u00e0, anche se c\u2019\u00e8 (potrebbe aiutare essere consapevoli che un comune errore sta nel credere che gli astronauti galleggino perch\u00e9 non sentono la gravit\u00e0 nello spazio).", "fulldesc": "La levitazione magnetica \u00e8 un metodo con il quale un oggetto \u00e8 sospeso senza supporto, ad eccezione del campo magnetico.

At the end of each subsection, we provided links where teachers can read more about these topics.\n\n**The composition of the Sun**<br/>\nThe Sun is a giant gaseous ball composed of mostly hydrogen and helium. Due to the extremely high temperatures in the Sun, the electrons can detach from their atom\u2019s nuclei and are free to move. This state of matter is called \u201cplasma\u201d.  \n \nThe Sun can be divided into 5 layers: the core, the radiative zone, the convective zone, the photosphere, and the atmosphere. The core is the innermost layer and it is the place where energy is produced by nuclear fusion (~ 15 million \u00b0C). The radiative zone extends from the core to about 70% of the solar radius and here the energy is transported mainly through radiation (photons are emitted, absorbed and re-emitted continuously). In the next layer, the convective zone, energy is transported by convection (upward movement of hot matter and downward movement of cold matter, similar to the boiling of a soup). The photosphere, at ~ 6000 \u00b0C, sits right above the convective zone. Since it is the layer from which most of the light comes, we call it the solar surface, although we would not be able to stand on it. \n \nBeyond the photosphere, we find the solar atmosphere, which is composed of two other layers: the chromosphere and the corona. The chromosphere is a thin reddish gaseous layer immediately above the surface. The corona is the Sun\u2019s very thin plasma atmosphere, extending millions of kilometres into space.\n\nVisit http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov for more information.\n\n**Galileo\u2019s sunspot observations**<br/> \nIn 1612 Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope at the Sun. He was one of the first to do this, preceded by Thomas Harriott and Johannes Fabricius. Galileo knew that if he looked directly through the telescope, he could burn his eye. Instead, he projected the image on a screen to make careful drawings. In Galileo\u2019s time people believed that the Sun was a still, perfectly immaculate object. To his great surprise, he saw dark spots on the Sun. He was very intrigued by the nature of these spots, and therefore he observed and sketched them on a daily basis to study them.\n \nVisit http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/sunspots.html for more information.\n \n**The magnetic nature of sunspots**<br/> \nThe nature of sunspots remained an enigma until 1905, when the astronomer George Ellery Hale detected intense magnetic fields within these dark regions. Using a spectroheliograph he found that a certain property of the light (polarisation) emitted by the Sun was altered in a way that is specifically caused by magnetic fields. Today, satellites like Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are equipped with special instruments to detect the location of magnetic fields on the Sun and infer their intensity. Figure 1 shows two images of the same day, obtained by SDO: a visible-light image of the whole solar disc and a map of the orientation and intensity of the magnetic fields present on the solar disc (magnetogram). \n\nSunspots are seen in the photosphere as dark features in contrast to the rest of the solar surface, because the matter within them is about 2000 \u00b0C cooler than their surroundings at ~ 6000 \u00b0C. The intense magnetic fields are responsible for this cooling. Since magnetic fields produce pressure, plasma inside sunspots is forced out to maintain pressure equilibrium between the sunspot (gas pressure plus magnetic pressure) and the surrounding plasma (gas pressure). Therefore the plasma inside the sunspot is less dense and a little cooler.\n \nSunspots usually clump together in groups and have lifetimes between several days and weeks. Sunspots are dynamic and evolve together with the magnetic field: they appear, change, disappear. Their number varies periodically with time together with the amount of magnetic field of the Sun, following the so-called 11-year sunspot cycle: every 11 years, the sunspot number and the amount of magnetic field reach a maximum (called \u201csolar maximum\u201d), followed by a minimum with barely any spots on the Sun. The dataset proposed in this activity is chosen close to the solar maximum, in order to display a large number of sunspots.\n\nSunspots are found in patches like storms on Earth and are usually located in bands in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The bands that sunspots form in, move from mid-latitudes to almost the equator throughout the 11-year sunspot cycle.  Note that individual sunspots do not drift much in latitude since they only exist for a few weeks - just the latitudes where new spots form move towards the equator.\n \n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig1.png) \nFig. 1: Magnetogram and visible light image of the solar disc on the same day (see text for more details).\n \n- Visit http://solar-center.stanford.edu/solar-images/magnetograms.html for more information on solar magnetograms.\n \n- Visit https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/how-sdo-sees-the-sun for more information on visible-light images of the Sun.\n \n**The rotation of the Sun**<br/> \nAs seen from the Earth the Sun rotates about its axis in about 27 days.  The Sun's equator is almost in the plane of the Earth's orbit so the Sun's north pole is in the same direction as the Earth's north pole. Seen from above the solar north pole, the Sun rotates counter-clockwise.  Most modern images of the Sun are oriented so that the solar north is up and features on its surface then move from left to right as the Sun rotates.  Note that Galileo's drawings of sunspots (Fig. 3) are not oriented this way.    \n\n**The non-rigid rotation of the Sun**<br/>\nRigid objects do not change shape (i.e. they are non-deformable). Therefore, when rigid objects spin every part rotates at the same rhythm. This means that every part of the object takes the same amount of time to complete a turn. This is called rigid rotation. This is the reason why every spot on Earth takes 24 hours to complete a turn.\n\nIn non-rigid objects, i.e. deformable objects, rotation is different in different parts of the object. This is the case of the Sun since it is made up of a gaseous matter called plasma. Like the Earth, the Sun has a North pole and a South pole, and rotates around its axis. However, the Sun\u2019s plasma near the equator completes a full turn in a little less than 27 days, whereas plasma near the poles can complete a full turn in as much as 35 days. This means that plasma can rotate at different speeds, depending on the latitude they are at: i.e. faster at the equator than at the poles. This is called differential rotation.\n \nIf you measure the Earth's rotation by measuring winds or the motion of clouds, you will find that the rotation of the Earth's atmosphere also varies with latitude. This is because the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is a gas and not a solid. As seen from space, the atmosphere rotates in less than 24 hours at mid-latitudes and in more than 24 hours near the equator. We call this the \"Westerlies\" and \"Trade winds\" respectively.  Differential rotation is not a unique aspect of the Sun; it is common for rotating bodies such as other stars and gaseous planets to have different rotation rates at different latitudes.\n\nVisit http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/D/Differential+Rotation for more information.\n\n**The Solar Dynamics Observatory**<br/> \nThe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is a satellite mission from NASA. It was launched into an orbit around the Earth in 2010 and it has been observing the Sun since then. SDO\u2019s main goal is to study the solar atmosphere to understand better the relationship between the solar magnetic fields and energetic, short-term phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections.\n \nVisit http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov for more information.\n \n**Other useful links about the solar cycle**<br/>\nhttp://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtml\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sASbVkK-p0w\n", "fulldesc": "*Tips to the teacher:*\n \nThis part requires students to carefully follow steps of actions, so it is advisable to have a lab worksheet prepared to distribute to them.\n \nIf you have a beamer and an internet connection, we encourage the use of a google spreadsheet for students to list their results (see Discussion part). This enables them to work collaboratively and compare their results. It also allows you to easily average their results as well as to graph them. Otherwise, you can draw a large measurement table on the blackboard for students to write their measurements (and easily erase them if they find calculation errors).\n\n*Observed student difficulties:*\n\nIn this activity, students want to compute the rotation period T  by using the speed v of a sunspot and the length of its trajectory L: T = L/v. Some students are confused by the fact that neither L nor v is known (unlike in a conventional problem statement), and the teacher must insist that this is precisely why they should be measured.\n\nThis activity requires students to use twice the equation for average speed: To calculate the displacement speed of a sunspot, and to compute the rotation period. Some students confuse the two. To guide the students, the teacher can, for instance, write in big the equations on the blackboard with the link between them, as in Fig. 2 below. We suggest not to do so right at the beginning, for students to come up with those links themselves, but later in the activity, once they\u2019ve figured it out.\n\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig2.JPG) \nFig. 2: Equations used in the activity and the link between them.\n\n###**1. INTRODUCTION**\n\n1) Engage students in the historical context of this activity, by telling them how Galileo \u201csurprisingly\u201d discovered moving sunspots on the Sun. \n\n2) Tell them how, at the time of Galileo, the heavens were considered \u201cstill and immaculate\u201d. But Galileo was curious and determined to test ideas by himself. When he pointed his telescope to the Sun, he discovered, to his great surprise, that the Sun had dark spots and that from one day to the next, these were moving across the solar surface.\n\n3) Distribute to the class copies of Galileo's drawings (file 'Galileo drawings.pdf'), also shown in Fig. 3\n\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig3.jpg) \nFig. 3: Galileo Galilei\u2019s drawings from 24-27 June 1613. Note that the solar north pole is not oriented straight up, as it usually is in modern scientific images.\n\n4) If you have a beamer, you can project the movie 'Galileo drawings'.\n\n5) Ask them what they think these sunspots could be, and tell them that Galileo himself was puzzled (we only know their \u201cmagnetic\u201d nature since 1905, see Background).\n\n6) Ask them why they think sunspots appear to be moving.\n\n7) If you have a beamer, play a movie of the Sun rotating with the SDO images provided by the activity (in .jpg format, as these do not have latitude lines). This way the students can \u201csee\u201d and \u201cfeel\u201d the solar rotation. You can use the free astronomy-for-classroom software SalsaJ (see \u201cHow to create an animation with several images\u201d at http://eu-hou.net/index.php/salsaj-software-mainmenu-9/manual-salsaj-2)\n\n8) While they watch the movie, insist on the idea that everything is in motion in the Universe and everything spins!\n\n9) Make students come up with the idea of measuring the rotation period and how to do it.\n\nAsk them:\n- Knowing that the Sun is rotating, what could we try to measure?\n- If you had these images (the ones shown in the movie) in your hands, how do you think you could determine the rotation period?\n*They might say that we could wait for a sunspot to make a complete turn and reappear at the same position. Unfortunately, most sunspots do not \u201clive\u201d that long.*\n- What if you could measure the average speed of a sunspot?\n\n10) Group students in pairs and give each pair an example of a printed dataset (at least two images) or show them how to find the images on the computer if doing the activity electronically (www.solarmonitor.org).\n\n11) Now that students are convinced that the Sun is a rotating celestial body, their task as scientists will be to calculate as precisely as possible the time it takes to complete a full rotation, that we call the rotation period T.\n \n###**2. MODELLING THE TRAJECTORY OF SUNSPOTS**\n \n**Model**\u2013 We will assume that the Sun is perfectly spherical and that it rotates as a rigid body at a constant pace. In that case, the Sunspots on the solar surface are moving at a constant speed.\n \nWith this simple model, calculating the rotation period is equivalent to determining the time needed for a sunspot to complete a full turn around the Sun.\n\nStudents should first grasp how we can describe the motion of a sunspot on a spherical Sun and how the rotation period relates to the sunspot speed and trajectory length.\n\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig4.png)   \nFig. 4: Sketch of a sunspot\u2019s trajectory as seen from Earth (front view), and the same trajectory if we could see the Sun in top view, evidencing a circular trajectory (in green).\n\n1) Draw schematics of the Sun along with a sunspot and its trajectory as viewed from the front (i.e. as we would see it from Earth). See Fig. 4.\n\n2) Let students complete the top view  (i.e. if we were looking at the Sun from above its North pole) and add the trajectory of the Sunspot represented in the front view (in green in the image below). We will note the length of this trajectory as L. What is the shape of this trajectory? Figure 4 shows the correct circular trajectory as a dashed-green line. \n\n3) Ask students: If they knew the speed of a sunspot v, and the length of the trajectory L, how could they compute the rotation period of the Sun? We will note this period as T.\n\n4) Let students write their equation for T: they should find T = L/v.\n\n5) Write their equation in big letters on the board.\n\n6) Explain to students that in this problem, L and v are unknowns. How to find them? They\u2019ll need to measure them from the images.\n\n7) Ask the students to check the units in the equation: To compute the rotation period with their equation, do they need to know the scale of the images (i.e. to have distances in km), or can they simply use a ruler and measure distances in cm and speeds in cm/h? Students should find that the distance units cancel out in the equation for T. Although images are smaller spatial representations of reality, the time dimension is unchanged.\n\n###**3. MEASURING THE SPEED OF A SUNSPOT**\n\nTo benefit the final discussion, it is best that each student group works with a different sunspot, in order to compare the measurements performed on different spots.\n\n1) Depending on the number of students and the activity timing, you can either let them choose a sunspot number (indicated on the images) within the complete dataset or assign a sunspot number to each student pair from the start. In the latter case, it is sufficient to give them two consecutive images featuring that spot near the disk centre.\n\n2) If you did not assign a specific sunspot to each group, tell students to look at the dataset, choose a sunspot and find its 5-digit number. Make sure that different student pairs chose different sunspots (write them on the blackboard or on a google spreadsheet if you can project it);\n\n3) Tell them to look at consecutive images of that spot and think about how they could measure the average speed of that spot in [cm/h].\n\n4) Assuming that sunspots move at a constant speed on the surface of the Sun, their instantaneous speed at any instant in time is equal to their average speed. We can then simply apply the equation of the average speed between two images :\n \nv = d/tel = (distance travelled between the two images) / (elapsed time between the images) [cm/h]\n\n5) By using a flexible ruler on a spherical ball (simulating the Sun) as in Fig. 5, ask students where is it easier to read the ruler to estimate distances: near the centre or near the edge of the ball? This should guide the students to the idea of taking two consecutive images of a sunspot near the disk centre. Otherwise, the distances will appear foreshortened. For the same reason, it is best that the images are close in time (in the case of this dataset, the minimum separation is one day).\n \n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig5.JPG)   \nFig. 5: A flexible ruler on a ball illustrates that in an image of a spherical object, only the distances measured near the disk centre are accurate because the distances nearer the limb are foreshortened.\n\nFrom here, student teams can follow these steps:\n \n1) Pick two consecutive images of their numbered sunspot near disk centre. \n\n2) Think about a method to measure as precisely as possible the distance travelled d (cm) by the spot between the two consecutive images, with the help of a ruler. As an example, Fig. 6 shows the displacement of sunspot 12218 between the 29th and 30th November. (With the paper version of the activity, students can use the left edge of the images as a reference to place the ruler, or the white longitude lines on the images as help to place their rulers.)\n\n3) Find the elapsed time t (h) between the two consecutive images (the time at which an image was taken is indicated at the top of each image).\n\n4) Compute the speed v.\n\n5) Write the measurements on the blackboard or in a google spreadsheet.\n\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig6.png)    \nFig.  6: Measuring displacement. Letter \u201cd\u201d represents the distance travelled by a spot between two consecutive images (see text for more information). \n \n###**4. MEASURING THE LENGTH OF THE TRAJECTORY**\n \nStudents should :\n \n- Draw the diameter D of the trajectory on the front and top views of the sketches of they did at the beginning of the activity (see Fig. 7).\n\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig7.png)     \nFig. 7: Sketch of the full diameter travelled by a sunspot.\n \n- Measure the diameter D of the sunspot\u2019s trajectory on the images as shown in Fig. 8. How can this measurement be used to compute the length of the trajectory L? Students are expected to use the perimeter-diameter relationship for a circle: L = \u03c0D\n \n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig8.jpg)  \nFig. 8: Measuring the diameter D of the spot trajectory (in this case sunspot 12236) \n \n###**5. COMPUTING THE ROTATION PERIOD**\n \n- Students can use their previous measurements to compute the rotation period T in hours and in terrestrial days (1 day = 24 h) using the formula: T = L/v.\n- When they finish, students should write all their values on the blackboard table or the google spreadsheet.\n- Using the blackboard or a google spreadsheet will make all their results visible to the class and facilitate the discussion (see Table 1 for an example).\n\nTable 1: Measurements taken for all sunspots that were near the disk centre for two consecutive days. The mean value of T is 26.8 terrestrial days for this dataset.\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_sunspots_numbers.png) \n\n###**6. COMPARING AND DISCUSSING THE MEASUREMENTS**\n \nNow the student teams will compare their results between themselves and with the official value. They should obtain rotation period values close to 26 or 27 days, otherwise, check for calculation errors.\n\nAlso, pay attention to whether students have chosen images where their spot is near the disk centre, otherwise they will underestimate the distance travelled by the spots between the two images, and therefore underestimate the velocity and overestimate the rotation period (see below).\n \n- Show them the official value from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation) or NASA (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/solar-rotation.html), or tell them to search for it if they are on a computer. You have to search for the \u201csynodic\u201d rotation period (about 27 days).\n\n*How close are they from the official value?*\n\n*You can make them compute a relative error.*\n\n- Ask them to examine all results of T: *Did all student pairs agree on the same value? Let\u2019s find out why!*\n\n- Each team shall explain to the rest of the class how they performed their measurement (especially of the distance travelled d).\n\n*Can you find some measurements errors or calculation errors?*\n\n*As scientists, it is crucial to discuss why we did not obtain a single \u201ctrue\u201d answer to our question. The experimental nature of science means that we never get a unique answer: Measurement results fluctuate either because the phenomenon itself fluctuates or because WE fluctuate in our way of measuring things! So let us consider explanations for the discrepancies.*\n\n- If you recorded the measurements of students in a spreadsheet, you can plot their values of T against sunspot number to make them see the dispersion in their results (see Fig. 9).\n\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig9.png)  \nFig. 9: Rotation period vs. Sunspot number for all the spots measured in Table 1. The horizontal line is the mean value of the dataset.\n \n- Make students think about the phenomenon of solar rotation and the model they used to describe it:\n\n*Think about the model we considered to start with\u2026 can we really model the Sun as a rigid body? Why or why not?*\n\n*How about the sunspots, do they look exactly the same on two consecutive days? Why or why not?*\n\n*Scientists have shown that the rotation period is longer near the poles (sidereal rotation period of up to 38 days) than at the equator (about 25 days), a phenomenon called differential rotation or non-rigid rotation. Yet students won't be able to clearly see this on your dataset because most spots are close to the equator.*\n\n- Ask students: How can we combine all measurements to compare them with the official value?\n\n*We can compute an average value and its uncertainty. At school level, the uncertainty can simply be taken as a \u201cdispersion\u201d or \u201crank\u201d, taking care of removing outlier measurements: (max value - min value)/2. Here we find a dispersion of \u00b12 days (a more proper standard deviation yields 1.4 days).*\n \n- Average the measurements of T obtained by all teams to get a class average (see Table 1 and Fig. 9). Compare again with the official value.\n\n*How close is it to the official value?*\n\n*Do they agree within the uncertainty of our measurement? That\u2019s great teamwork!*\n\n- Make students realize that they succeeded in measuring the rotation period of a star using only one Kinematics equation (average speed)!\n\n- Make students reflect about the meaning of their average value of T: \n\n*Compare the rotation period of the Sun you calculated with the rotation period of the Earth: is it shorter? longer? Does it make sense to you (think about the relative sizes)?*\n\n*Suppose you are a solar astronomer and find a new sunspot appearing near the left border of the solar disk. How long do you have to observe this spot before it disappears on the right side?*\n\n- Finally, let us question the observer\u2019s perspective on the average rotation period. Does it really represent the time that the Sun actually takes to rotate on itself, or is it also a matter of the observer's perspective? Think about the fact that the images were taken from Earth, which revolves around the Sun.\n\nSince we have not taken into account the motion of the Earth around the Sun in our treatment, all we can say is that as viewed from the Earth (in this case, from the SDO satellite that orbits the Earth), a feature on the Sun's surface completes one rotation on around the Sun in about 27 Earth days (which is called \u201csynodic\u201d rotation period). Yet because the Earth orbits the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (see Fig. 10), this rotation period as seen from the Earth is longer than the rotation period of the Sun seen from a static observer, which is about 25 days (called the \u201csidereal\u201d rotation period).\n\n![](https://astroedu.iau.org/media/activities/attach/b246cbf9-a5b6-42b4-8779-4cdc8bdf99e6/astroedu1801_fig10.png)  \nFig. 10: Sketch showing how the Earth revolves around the Sun in the same direction as the Sun\u2019s rotation.\n\n", "curriculum": "", "additional_information": "This activity demonstrates to students the power of a simple definition from classical Kinematics and how it can be used to perform a rather precise calculation. It fits well inside an introductory physics course such as a first-year high-school, where Kinematics and basic Astronomy are studied.\n \n", "conclusion": "Students start the activity with some evidence that our star, the Sun, also rotates about its own axis, like the Earth. \nWith the aim of determining the rotation period of the Sun, they use modern satellite images of the Sun and apply

kinematics equations are to describe motion.\n\nBy comparing their results, they become also aware of their dispersion and of its possible sources: measurement errors by them, and non-rigid rotation

This process increases the quality of the scientific content, educational implementation and credibility of the activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does astroEDU expect to achieve?</strong> astroEDU tries to solve some past issues with educational activities: Many of the educational activities are difficult to find, difficult to use. The number of existing activities is large, but their quality is often difficult to judge. Through peer-review astroEDU is improving standards of quality, visibility and providing credibility to educational activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What incentive is there for the activity creators?</strong> The same way that peer-reviewed scholarly articles are the base for performance evaluation of scholars, astroEDU will provide a new metric to assess the quality of the work developed by educators. The activities will also be given higher visibility with much wider distribution through the partner networks and the official seal of the IAU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Which license does astroEDU use?</strong> One of the main goals of the astroEDU is to promote the use of excellent activities worldwide. That is the reason why all the astroEDU activities will be licensed through the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about other languages?</strong> At the moment astroEDU is a prototype to test the infrastructure and procedures. We already accept activity submission in different languages, although the astroEDU on-line platform is only available in English for now. However, language support will follow as soon as astroEDU leaves the prototype phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Could you be a reviewer?</strong> If you are an educator or research astronomer who would be willing to review submitted activities, please get in touch. www.iau.org/astroedu</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is behind astroEDU?</strong> astroEDU is a project of the International Astronomical Union under the framework of the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Editor-in-chief:</strong> Michael Fitzgerald (ECU, Australia)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Editor-at-large:</strong> Jaya Ramchandani (The Story Of Foundation/Sirius Interactive, India)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Managing Editors:</strong> Edward Gomez (LCOGT, UK) and Pedro Russo (UNAWE/Leiden University, the Netherlands)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Assistant Editor:</strong> Thilina Heenatigala (UNAWE, Sri Lanka)</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Editorial Board:</strong> Jen Gupta (UK), Robert Hollow (Australia), Ofodum Chukwujekwu Nworah (Nigeria), Amelia Ortiz-Gil (Spain), Tsolmon Renchin (Mongolia), Lina Canas (OAO/Japan), Linda Strubbe (Canada/USA), Akihiko Tomita (Japan), Paulo Bretones (Brazil), Richard de Grijs (Australia), Rhodri Evans (UK).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Support:</strong> IAU OAD, Universe Awareness, Leiden University, LCOGT, Space Awareness, Europlanet and European Union.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>IAU astroEDU is part of Europlanet 2020 RI and EU Space Awareness projects and it has received funding from the European Union&#39;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements No 654208</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzapa19mgum6wu7/astroEDUA0poster6.pdf?dl=0\">Download astroEDU poster</a>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find the website code on github. <a href=\"https://github.com/unawe/astroEDU\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://astroedu.iau.org/static/designimages/GitHub_Logo.png\" style=\"display:inline; height:20px; margin:0px 5px; position:relative; top:10px; width:49px\" /></a></p>\r\n"}}, {"model": "smartpages.smartpagetranslation", "pk": 2, "fields": {"language_code": "en", "master": 2, "url": "/guidelines_old/", "title": "Activity Preparation and Submission Guidelines", "content": "<p>This a short guide for anyone who is considering submitting an activity to the astroEDU portal.</p>\n<h2>Preparing your activity</h2>\n<p>When considering preparing a new educational activity or updating an existing one, it is useful to spend some time considering the goals of your programme. A well constructed activity can assist in a student\u2019s skills and scientific understanding, but also their enjoyment and perception of science.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Consider your audience</strong>:\nWhen constructing your activity you should always consider who your audience is and what their background is. Your audience may have preconceptions about the topic of your activity. Include explicit ways to draw out students' prior knowledge, or ways that will allow them to explore any misconceptions instead of reinforcing them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Appeal to students with mixed abilities</strong>:\nIdeally you should incorporate ways that students with different abilities can all gain something from the activity. This could be through different starting/ending points or performing a smaller set of tasks during the course of the activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Clearly state your goals</strong>:\nGoals are the broad concepts that you aim to address through your activity. Examples of goals are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students will have an appreciation of how the Moon phases are created.</li>\n<li>Students will understand the consequences of space travel</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Create objectives</strong>:\nDetermine how teachers and students will know they have achieved the goals of the activity. This is very dependent on the type of activity you are designing an the exact nature of your goals. By creating objectives, you will also help the students to achieve the goals. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students will be able to make a model of the Earth-Moon system, and by moving the Moon to different positions be able to describe how the phase changes through the course of a month.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Design your activity to help your learners achieve the goals and objectives.</strong>:\nGive the educators  (or anyone else who might be delivering the content) ideas how they can evaluate the activity, and how the students skills and understanding is developing. If your learners did not achieve your goals at the level you intended, use what you learned about your students to revise the activity, for next time, so that it supports them further in reaching your goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Evaluate your activity</strong>:\nEvaluation should be incorporated into the activity if possible, to avoid making it a chore for the teachers and students.

It constitutes a form of regulation by qualified members of a community within the relevant field. The astroEDU peer review method is employed to maintain standards of quality, improve visibility and provide credibility to the astronomy educational activities.</p>\n<h2>Peers as Referees</h2>\n<p>All the astroEDU activities will be submitted to 2 referees.  Referees are among the most important assets of astroEDU.  astroEDU has two categories of referees: Content Specialist referees and Education referees.  The content referee is a research scientist from the scientific field of the activity (eg.:  if the activity is about the Sun we will have a solar physicist reviewing the activity). The educational referee is an educator with experience in education of the level and age of the target audience of the activity (eg. if the activity is for primary school children the education referee will be a primary school teacher or someone with experience in primary school education).</p>\n<h2>Rubric Measurement</h2>\n<p>We have created two separate rubrics. One for <a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://astroedu.iau.org/media/files/PeerReview-ContentSpecialist.pdf\">content specialists</a> and one for <a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://astroedu.iau.org/media/files/PeerReview-Educator.pdf\">educators</a> to help assess the quality of submitted activities in a standardised way that shouldn't be too burdensome for reviewers.  Reviewers are asked to consider a variety of statements to guide their own comments and suggestions.  Activity authors are encouraged to read and consider the rubric while designing activities as well to help guide the designing process.</p>\n<h2>Referee's Reports</h2>\n<p>The Editor keeps contact with the referees by email. When a referee is asked to produce a report, she/he should respond to the Editor as soon as possible, stating whether she/he accepts to act as a referee. In the case of a negative answer, the suggestion of (an) other referee(s) is warmly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Reports should be written in such a way as to help the author address any issues identified with the activity. Suggested changes to a activity should be clearly stated.</p>\n<p>The referee concludes the assessment with one of the following recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not accept activity.</li>\n<li>This activity requires significant revisions before acceptance</li>\n<li>Accept activity subject to minor revisions</li>\n<li>Accept activity with no revisions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once activities have been modified by the author they may be resent to the referee for re-evaluation (if only minor modifications are required the Editor may fulfill this duty).</p>\n<p>Referees are also asked to provide recommendations on how to improve (if necessary) the language and visual communication of the activity. Referees are kindly requested to produce their reports within 3 weeks. In case they need more time, or cannot produce their report in a reasonable time, or are at all unable to produce a report, they are strongly requested to contact the Editors at their earliest convenience. Referee reports need to be submitted to the editor and not to the original author.\n\f</p>\n<h2>Publication</h2>\n<p>The Editor decides upon the acceptance of each activity on the basis of the referees' reports and of the general astroEDU style. The final version of the activity will be sent to the editorial board for the approval. Once the final decision has been made the Editor will notify the author not normally more than 4 weeks from the date of the original submission (this will depend on the level of modifications needed by the author).</p>\n<p>All accepted activities will be immediately made available on astroEDU (including the epub and PDF versions) unless a delay is requested by the author or the editorial board.</p>\n<h2>Community Feedback</h2>\n<p>Based on comments and feedback provided by the astroEDU website audience, the astroEDU editor will moderate these comments and will try to incorporate the suggestions in the activity. If the changes are large, the editor will explore the creation of a new activity which goes through the peer-review again, which is built out of the original activity.</p>\n<h2>Volunteer</h2>\n<p>If you are a professional astronomer or an educator, and would like to volunteer to peer-review astroEDU activities, please fill in the <a href=\"https://unawe.typeform.com/to/UIBI5e\" target=\"_blank\">online form.</a></p>\n"}}, {"model": "smartpages.smartpagetranslation", "pk": 4, "fields": {"language_code": "en", "master": 4, "url": "/faq/", "title": "F.A.Q.", "content": "<p><strong>Could you be a reviewer?</strong></p>\n<p>If you are an educator or research astronomer who would be willing to review submitted activities, please fill in the <a href=\"https://unawe.typeform.com/to/UIBI5e\" target=\"_blank\">online form.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Can anyone submit activities?</strong></p>\n<p>We welcome astronomers, educators, teachers and students to submit astronomy educational activities.

Enquiry-based learning describes an approach to learning that is based on the \"investigation\" of questions, scenarios or problems - often assisted by a teacher or educator. It can be thought of as \u201clearning which is aimed squarely at a particular set of student skills\u201d.</p>\n<p>At astroEDU we believe guided enquiry represents a clear, ambitious, yet realistic goal to aim for in changing teachers\u2019 practice and we encourage all the activities to use this type of approach to activities design. It allows the teacher to retain sufficient responsibility to limit the \u2018riskiness\u2019, and ensure focus on desired curriculum outcomes. Yet, it still offers students a high degree of autonomy and the \u2018pleasure of discovery\u2019 as described by Richard Feynman.

However, the research into open-ended enquiry or \u2018minimally guided instruction\u2019 has shown it to be less effective compared to traditional methods. It presents many challenges to inexperienced students and is also far removed from standard-based education systems.</p>\n<p>The 5 areas of the inquiry skill-set are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Learners engaged by scientifically oriented questions</li>\n<li>Learners give priority to evidence in responding to questions</li>\n<li>Learners formulate explanations from evidence</li>\n<li>Learners connect explanations to scientific knowledge</li>\n<li>Learners communicate and justify explanations to others</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This skill-set view can be elaborated to accommodate the student-centred elements of other views.  \u2013 For inquiry activity is not as an all-or-nothing affair, but can be considered as a hierarchical set of levels as shown in the table below .  The levels represent the degree of ownership given to the student.

However, the research into open enquiry or \u2018minimally guided instruction\u2019 has shown it to be less effective compared to traditional methods. The explanation has been given in terms of the unrealistic cognitive demands it places on \u2018novices\u2019. It is also likely to create the most challenges and prove unlikely to be acceptable within our contemporary standards-based education systems. By contrast, Level 2, is much more pragmatic.

Here's the idea in more detail:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide on clear <strong>overall goals</strong> and state why they are important for students to learn.  More info on designing goals is below.</li>\n<li>Decide on specific <strong>learning objectives</strong>: what do you want students to know / understand / do / feel after having finished the activity? And what <strong>evidence</strong> would tell you that your learners are reaching these objectives? (e.g., the students ask their own questions in class; they get particular questions right on a test; they state a desire to take more science classes next year)</li>\n<li>Design your activity to help your learners achieve these goals, and including places for you to assess their progress during and after the activity.</li>\n<li>During and after the activity, <strong>evaluate</strong> how well your learners have achieved your goals.  A rubric can be a useful tool for evaluating student learning.</li>\n<li>If your learners did not achieve your goals at the level you intended, use what you learned about your students to <strong>revise</strong> the activity, for next time, so that it supports them further in reaching your goals.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Designing activity goals</h2>\n<p>There are three distinct types of goals to consider: scientific content, scientific practices, and scientific attitudes.  Consider your audience and what their background is, and how you would like your learners' understanding, abilities and thinking to change as a result of the activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific content: </strong> What do we want students to know or understand?</p>\n<p>e.g., \"The Moon appears to go through phases because of how much of the Moon's illuminated \nface we see from Earth as the Moon orbits around us each month.\"</p>\n<p>Consider choosing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>big-picture topics that are of long-lasting importance,</li>\n<li>concepts that involve explanations, rather than just vocabulary or phenomenology, such as \"... happens because ...\",</li>\n<li>topics related to everyday observations students can make,</li>\n<li>topics that are \"cool\" that can inspire students, even if these are hard for students to understand at any deep level (e.g., black holes)</li>\n<li>topics where research is ongoing, to let students in on the mystery-solving aspect of real scientific research</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scientific practices</strong></p>\n<p>What do you want your students to be able to do, how do you want to affect their thinking, and what skills do you want them to develop?  These aspects are important in helping all students think scientifically about the world, whether or not they pursue careers in science.  A framework for enumerating scientific practices (from the U.S.\u2019s Next Generation Science Standards; NRC 2012) is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asking questions</li>\n<li>Developing and using models</li>\n<li>Planning and carrying out investigations</li>\n<li>Analysing and interpreting data</li>\n<li>Using mathematics and computational thinking</li>\n<li>Constructing explanations</li>\n<li>Engaging in argument from evidence</li>\n<li>Communicating information</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scientific attitudes:</strong></p>\n<p>Educational activities can affect how students (and perhaps even their teachers) feel about science and education:  Example goals:  Students feel...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inspired to pursue their education</li>\n<li>inspired to study science further</li>\n<li>inspired to become an astronomer</li>\n<li>connected to their culture's astronomical discoveries</li>\n<li>more curious and interested in observing the world around them</li>\n<li>empowered to ask why about science observations, and beyond, in their lives</li>\n<li>empowered to figure things out for themselves</li>\n<li>connected to (and respectful of) people from very different backgrounds from themselves (getting perspective from the smallness of the planet and the vastness of the cosmos)                        </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inquiry-based learning</h2>\n<p>Inquiry-based learning is a powerful means for students to learn both scientific content and scientific reasoning together.  Essential parts of inquiry are students learning science in ways that mirror authentic scientific research practices, developing explanations, and having ownership over the path of their learning.  We encourage you to consider ways to incorporate inquiry into your activity, and have prepared some additional information about <a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://astroedu.iau.org/ebl\">inquiry-based learning</a>.</p>\n<h2>Other tips to help your resource to be used widely:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Students may have prior knowledge (correct or incorrect) about the topic of your activity. Include explicit ways to draw out students' prior knowledge, and ways that will allow them to explore preconceptions.</li>\n<li>Consider ways for students with different levels of background knowledge or ability to benefit from the activity: e.g., provide opportunities for different starting/ending points in an investigation; different ways to demonstrate learning (writing, speaking, drawing).</li>\n<li>Avoid using colloquial language or technical jargon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Suggested further reading below.</h2>\n<p>If you have suggestions of other resources we should include, please send us an email!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chinn C.

Different educators and researchers have described inquiry-based learning activities in different ways (e.g., Banchi &amp; Bell 2008, Chinn &amp; Malhotra 2002, Hunter et al. 2010, National Research Council 2000, Ontario Ministry of Education 2013), but most agree that the essence of inquiry is learning science in ways that mirror authentic scientific research practices, or \u201clearning science as science is done\u201d (Hunter et al. 2010).  Scientific practices (sometimes called core skills, or reasoning skills, or critical thinking) are ways of thinking about and doing science.  A framework for enumerating scientific practices (from the U.S.\u2019s Next Generation Science Standards; NRC 2012) is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asking questions</li>\n<li>Developing and using models</li>\n<li>Planning and carrying out investigations</li>\n<li>Analysing and interpreting data</li>\n<li>Using mathematics and computational thinking</li>\n<li>Constructing explanations</li>\n<li>Engaging in argument from evidence</li>\n<li>Communicating information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gaining competency at these practices is a critical part of becoming scientifically literate, and can be taught explicitly in astronomy education activities.  We encourage activity authors to consider deeply how to incorporate teaching scientific practices into activities they design.</p>\n<p>A framework for describing inquiry in astronomy (adapted from the Institute for Scientist &amp; Engineer Educators, Hunter et al. 2014) is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Student learning is motivated by investigating the answer to a question.</li>\n<li>The learning activity is focused on developing learners\u2019 competency with practices of doing and thinking about science and astronomy (as described in the list above).</li>\n<li>The learning activity is focused on foundational physics and astronomy concepts.</li>\n<li>Learning practices and concepts is intertwined:  students use scientific practices to gain conceptual understanding, and conceptual understanding motivates the use of scientific practices.</li>\n<li>Students have ownership over their learning and gaining competency.</li>\n<li>Students use evidence to develop explanations.</li>\n<li>The learning activity mirrors authentic scientific research.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Inquiry activities often involve students developing their own questions to investigate based on intriguing observed phenomena, working in groups to plan and carry out an investigation to answer their question, and communicating their results with classmates to give everyone a fuller understanding (e.g., Institute for Inquiry at the Exploratorium, 2014).  These activities are learner-centered, focused on what the learners do rather than on what the teacher does, but they are also not a free-for-all; the teacher has specific learning goals for students and can nudge and guide students towards those as the activity progresses.</p>\n<p>Education research supports teaching via inquiry-based activities. General findings from education research on how people learn science (e.g., NRC 2000) include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When students learn with understanding (more than just learning scientific facts), they are better able to apply knowledge to novel situations; and</li>\n<li>Effective learning requires that students take control of their own learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inquiry-based activities tend to teach science in ways that are in line with these and other research findings; in addition, education research tends to find that inquiry-based methods are effective at teaching conceptual understanding of scientific principles and comprehension of the nature of scientific reasoning and investigation.  Inquiry also promotes learning by students from a wide diversity of backgrounds (e.g., NRC 2000).  National reports in many countries on improving science education emphasize the importance of learning via inquiry-based methods (e.g., PKAL 2006).  For these many reasons, we encourage activity authors to consider how they can design astronomy education activities that incorporate inquiry.  (Nevertheless, we add that inquiry is only one tool in the educator\u2019s toolbox, and other teaching techniques play important roles as well.)</p>\n<p>Designing inquiry-based activities can be challenging, so we offer a few suggested questions to consider during the design process (and in reviewing activities):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are the concepts studied in the activity deep foundational parts of the subject area?</li>\n<li>Do students gain competency at scientific practices along with content?</li>\n<li>Is the activity motivated by investigating questions?</li>\n<li>Do students have some ownership over pathways to their learning?  (e.g., deciding the questions to investigate, and/or how to investigate questions)</li>\n<li>Do students use evidence to develop scientific explanations?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For feedback, questions, and ideas about inquiry-based teaching and learning, please contact the  <a href=\"mailto:astroedu@strw.leidenuniv.nl\">astroEDU editors</a>.</p>\n<h4>References &amp; Further Reading:</h4>\n<p>Banchi, H., &amp; Bell, R., The Many Levels of Inquiry, Science and Children, National Science Teachers Association, 46(2), 26-29 (2008) \n<a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://learningcenter.nsta.org/files/sc0810_26.pdf\">http://learningcenter.nsta.org/files/sc0810_26.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Chinn C.

Per esempio: &ldquo;lo scopo dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; &egrave; che gli studenti capiscano perch&eacute; ci sono stagioni diverse e anche quello di migliorare la loro abilit&agrave; nel comunicare scoperte scientifiche. Le stagioni sono importanti per capire perch&eacute; esse abbiano effetto sulla vita di ogni giorno e coinvolgono concetti sulla luce che sono importanti anche in molto altri contesti. Gli obiettivi didattici sono specificati pi&ugrave; sotto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Obiettivi didattici:</strong> specificare le competenze che gli studenti devono acquisire, in funzione anche del modo in cui essi dovranno dimostrare tali conoscenze. Per esempio, &ldquo;Gli studenti useranno il concetto di flusso solare in funzione dell&rsquo;angolo di incidenza per spiegare perch&eacute; a Milano &egrave; caldo d&rsquo;Estate e freddo in Inverno.&rdquo; La dimostrazione dell&rsquo;apprendimento dovr&agrave; essere direttamente collegata alla Valutazione (scheda successiva). E&rsquo; possibile trovare utelriori informazioni su <u>http://teachonline.asu.edu/objectives-builder/</u> and <u>http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Learning_objective</u>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Valutazione:</strong> Come l&rsquo;insegnante pu&ograve; raccogliere evidenza dell&rsquo;apprendimento dello studente, per valutare quanto gli studenti stiano raggiungendo gli obiettivi di cui sopra. Per esempio, &ldquo;Chiedere agli studenti di presentare dei poster ai loro compagni spiegando perch&eacute; a Milano fa caldo d&rsquo;Estate e freddo in Inverno.&rdquo; La valutazione pu&ograve; avere luogo sia durante lo svolgimento dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; quanto alla fine. (Per esempio: &ldquo;Mentre un gruppo di studenti discute sulle stagioni, far in modo che essi disegnino un&rsquo;immagine che descriva la diffusione della luce solare su aree diverse a seconda dell&rsquo;angolo di incidenza.&rdquo;). La scheda di valutazione dovrebbe includere sia quegli elementi che l&rsquo;insegnante deve considerare &nbsp;per capire se gli studenti hanno compreso, sia alcune indicazioni sugli errori comuni che indicano una comprensione ancora non completa. Questa scheda pu&ograve; anche includere indicazioni su come valutare le competenze nelle pratiche scientifiche indicate nella&nbsp;scheda che segue. Uno strumento utile alla valutazione dell&rsquo;apprendimento degli studenti &egrave; la scheda di valutazione (si veda&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/rubrics.html\" target=\"blank\">http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/rubrics.html</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Competenze:</strong> Questa sezione si riferisce alle pratiche nel fare scienza e nel ragionamento scientifico che gli studenti imparano da questa attivit&agrave;.&nbsp;Il quadro di riferimento per elencare le &ldquo;buone pratiche&rdquo; scientifiche (estratto da U.S.&rsquo;s Next Generation Science Standards; NRC 2012) &egrave;: porre domande, sviluppare e utilizzare modelli, pianificare ed eseguire ricerche (indagini), analizzare e interpretare i dati, utilizzare approcci matematici e computazionali, costruire spiegazioni valide, impegnarsi in una discussione partendo dall&rsquo;evidenza e comunicare le informazioni.

Molti esperti in didattica e ricercatori hanno descritto le attivit&agrave; dell&rsquo;<em>enquiry-based learning</em> in modi diversi (e.g., Banchi &amp; Bell 2008, Chinn &amp; Malhotra 2002, Hunter et al. 2010, National Research Council 2000, Ontario Ministry of Education 2013), ma c&#39;&egrave; un generale&nbsp;accordo che l&rsquo;essenza del metodo consista&nbsp;nel rispecchiare il procedimento proprio della ricerca scientifica: &egrave; come &ldquo;imparare la scienza nel medesimo modo in cui viene fatta&rdquo; (Hunter et al. 2010).&nbsp;Le <em>pratiche scientifiche</em> (che hanno a che fare con le <em>competenze</em>, con la <em>capacit&agrave; di ragionamento,</em> e con <em>pensiero critico)</em>&nbsp;sono modi di pensare alla scienza e al modo di farla. Il quadro di riferimento per elencare le &ldquo;buone pratiche&rdquo; scientifiche (estratto da U.S.&rsquo;s Next Generation Science Standards; NRC 2012) &egrave;:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>porre domande;</li>\r\n\t<li>sviluppare e utilizzare modelli;</li>\r\n\t<li>pianificare ed eseguire ricerche (indagini);</li>\r\n\t<li>analizzare e interpretare i dati;</li>\r\n\t<li>utilizzare approcci matematici e computazionali;</li>\r\n\t<li>costruire spiegazioni valide;</li>\r\n\t<li>impegnarsi in una discussione partendo dall&rsquo;evidenza;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>comunicare le informazioni.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>La competenza di queste pratiche &egrave; uno delle componenti fondamentali dell&rsquo;alfabetizzazione scientifica: e sono pratiche che possono essere esplicitamente insegnate proprio nelle attivit&agrave; di didattica dell&rsquo;Astronomia. Gli autori delle attivit&agrave; di astroEDU devono considerare con attenzione come includervi queste pratiche di insegnamento scientifico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Un riferimento per descrivere l&rsquo;<em>enquiry</em> in Astronomia (adattato da l&rsquo;Institute for Scientist &amp; Engineer Educators, Hunter et al. 2014) &egrave;:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;apprendimento dello studente &egrave; motivato dal cercare risposte a una domanda;</li>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; di apprendimento &egrave; focalizzata nel sviluppare la competenza degli studenti attraverso il fare e il pensare sulla scienza e l&rsquo;astronomia (come descritto nella lista pi&ugrave; sotto);</li>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; di apprendimento &egrave; basata sui concetti fondamentali della Fisica e dell&rsquo;Astronomia;</li>\r\n\t<li>le pratiche e i concetti di apprendimento sono strettamente correlati: gli studenti utilizzino le pratiche scientifiche per acquisire i concetti, e l&rsquo;acquisizione dei concetti motivi gli studenti a utilizzare le pratiche scientifiche;</li>\r\n\t<li>gli studenti devono dar prova del loro apprendimento e dell&rsquo;acquisizione di competenza;</li>\r\n\t<li>gli studenti devono usare prove per sviluppare delle spiegazioni;</li>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; d&rsquo;apprendimento rispecchia la vera ricerca scientifica.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Le attivit&agrave; di enquiry spesso richiedono che siano gli studenti a sviluppare le domande sui fenomeni osservati. Lavorando in gruppi per pianificare e implementare la loro indagine, dovranno poi trovare le risposte adeguate e comunicare i loro risultati agli altri compagni di classe, in modo da condividere con tutti la piena comprensione del fenomeno (vedi per esempio: Institute for Inquiry at the Exploratorium, 2014).&nbsp;Queste attivit&agrave; sono tutte centrate su chi apprende e&nbsp;focalizzate su ci&ograve; che gli studenti fanno piuttosto che su quel&nbsp;che deve fare l&rsquo;insegnante, ma non sono attivit&agrave; libere o senza indirizzo: l&rsquo;insegnante ha degli obiettivi specifici sull&rsquo;apprendimento dei suoi studenti e pu&ograve; orientarli e guidarli, man mano che l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; progredisce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>La ricerca in didattica appoggia molto l&rsquo;uso delle attivit&agrave; enquiry-based. I risultati generali della ricerca in didattica della scienza (e.g., NRC 2000) ci dicono che:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>quando gli studenti imparano attraverso la comprensione&nbsp;(invece di limitarsi a imparare alcuni fatti scientifici), sono anche molto pi&ugrave; abili poi nell&rsquo;applicare la conoscenza acquisita a situazioni nuove; e</li>\r\n\t<li>Un&#39;efficace&nbsp;acquisizione di conoscenza&nbsp;richiede che gli studenti abbiano la piena consapevolezza sul proprio apprendimento.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Le attivit&agrave; di EBL tendono a insegnare la scienza con metodologie che sono in linea con questi altri risultati di ricerca; in aggiunta, la ricerca in didattica &egrave; orientata a considerare l&#39;EBL&nbsp;efficace&nbsp;nel fornire piena comprensione concettuale dei principi scientifici e nella comprensione della vera natura dell&rsquo;indagine e del ragionamento scientifici. L&#39;EBL&nbsp;inoltre promuove l&rsquo;apprendimento da parte di studenti con ampia variet&agrave; di preparazione (e.g., NRC 2000). Report tecnici da diversi Paesi sullo sviluppo della didattica delle scienze enfatizzano l&rsquo;importanza dell&rsquo;apprendimento attraverso il metodo&nbsp;enquiry-based (e.g., PKAL 2006). &nbsp;E&#39; per&nbsp;tutte queste ragioni che incoraggiamo gli autori delle attivit&agrave; a pensare ad&nbsp;attivit&agrave; di didattica dell&rsquo;astronomia che includano l&#39;EBL.&nbsp;E tuttavia occorre aggiungere che che l&#39;EBL&nbsp;&egrave; solo uno dei metodi possibili&nbsp;e che altre tecniche di insegnamento possono ricoprire ruoli altrettanto importanti .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>La progettazione di un&#39;attivit&agrave; enquiry-based pu&ograve; essere molto complesso. Ecco allora alcune domande da tenere in considerazione durante la progettazione (e anche nella revisione, a dire il vero):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I concetti studiati nell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; sono parti fondanti dell&rsquo;area scientifica di cui l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; tratta?</li>\r\n\t<li>Gli studenti acquisiscono competenze nelle pratiche scientifiche oltre che contenuti?</li>\r\n\t<li>L&rsquo;attivit&agrave; &egrave; motivata da domande di indagine?</li>\r\n\t<li>Gli studenti hanno qualche autonomia nel seguire i percorsi verso l&rsquo;acquisizione della conoscenza? (per esempio, possono decidere su quali domande indagare, e/o come indagare su tali questioni)</li>\r\n\t<li>Gli studenti usano prove evidenti per motivare le loro spiegazioni scientifiche?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Per feedback, domande, e idee sull&rsquo;insegnamento e l&rsquo;apprendimento enquiry-based, per favore contattare la redazione di astroEDU&nbsp; (<a href=\"mailto:astroedu@brera.inaf.it?subject=astroedu%20italia\">astroEDU</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Bibliografia e ulteriori letture (in inglese)&nbsp;:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Banchi, H., &amp; Bell, R., The Many Levels of Inquiry, Science and Children, National Science Teachers Association, 46(2), 26-29 (2008) <a href=\"http://learningcenter.nsta.org/files/sc0810_26.pdf\" target=\"blank\">http://learningcenter.nsta.org/files/sc0810_26.pdf</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinn C.

Questo significa che invece di farsi prima venire in mente le attivit&agrave; specifiche che insegnanti e studenti dovranno svolgere e successivamente decidere quali sono gli obiettivi che conseguono a tali attivit&agrave;, bisognerebbe procedere all&rsquo;inverso: prima si definiscono le finalit&agrave;, gli obiettivi di apprendimento e si fa un piano di valutazione. Dopodich&eacute; si passa a progettare l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; adatta a supportare questi obiettivi. Di seguito questo processo un po&rsquo; pi&ugrave; in dettaglio:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Decidere chiaramente quali sono gli <strong>obiettivi generali</strong> dichiarando perch&eacute; essi sono importanti per l&rsquo;apprendimento degli studenti. Maggiori informazioni sulla progettazione degli obiettivi si trovano pi&ugrave; avanti.</li>\r\n\t<li>Decidere chiaramente gli <strong>obiettivi specifici di apprendimento</strong>: cosa volete che gli studenti sappiano / capiscano / facciano / provino dopo aver completato l&rsquo;attivit&agrave;?<br />\r\n\tE qual &egrave; la <strong>prova</strong> che vi dice se i vostri studenti stiano o no raggiungendo questi obiettivi? (Per esempio, gli studenti pongono domande appropriate in classe; rispondono in modo corretto a una o a pi&ugrave; domande particolari in un test; esplicitano il loro desiderio di fare pi&ugrave; scienza in classe l&rsquo;anno successivo; etc.)</li>\r\n\t<li>Progettate la vostra attivit&agrave; in modo da tale da agevolare gli studenti nel raggiungimento degli obiettivi, includendo anche degli spazi per stabilire il loro progresso durante e dopo l&rsquo;attivit&agrave;.</li>\r\n\t<li>Durante e a conclusione dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave;, <strong>valutate</strong> quanto e come i vostri studenti hanno raggiunto gli obiettivi.<br />\r\n\tUn&rsquo;utile strumento &egrave; senz&rsquo;altro la <strong>rubrica</strong> per la valutazione dell&rsquo;apprendimento dello studente (Paola C. ci ha passato esempi di rubriche di autovalutazione, sono sempre di autovalutazione, vanno usate sempre e in un certo modo&hellip;).</li>\r\n\t<li>Se i vostri studenti non hanno raggiunto gli obiettivi nel modo da voi voluto, usate quello che avete imparato dai vostri studenti stessi per fare una <strong>revisione</strong> dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; in modo che essa li supporti meglio nel raggiungimento degli obiettivi.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Progettare gli obiettivi dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave;&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ci sono tre diverse tipologie di obiettivi da tenere in considerazione: i contenuti scientifici, le pratiche scientifiche, e gli approcci scientifici (qui con attitudes si pu&ograve; intendere le disposizioni mentali&hellip;).&nbsp;<br />\r\nConsiderate inoltre qual &egrave; il vostro target (o pubblico), quali sono le loro conoscenze pregresse, e come vorreste che l&rsquo;apprendimento, le abilit&agrave; e le valutazioni dei vostri studenti cambiassero come risultato dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; che andrete a proporgli.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contenuti scientifici</strong>: Che cosa vogliamo che gli studenti conoscano o capiscano?<br />\r\nPer esempio, &ldquo;La Luna appare in fasi diverse e ci&ograve; dipende da quanta parte della sua superficie illuminata della Luna vediamo dalla Terra nel suo orbitare attorno a noi in un mese.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Si potrebbero scegliere:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Argomenti di ampio respiro che abbiano un&rsquo;importanza duratura</li>\r\n\t<li>Concetti che richiedano spiegazioni, piuttosto che descrizioni lessicali o fenomenologiche, come &ldquo;&hellip; accade perch&eacute; &hellip;&rdquo;,</li>\r\n\t<li>Argomenti legati a osservazioni di tutti i giorni che gli studenti possano svolgere in prima persona,</li>\r\n\t<li>Argomenti &ldquo;cool&rdquo; che ispirino e stimolino gli studenti, anche se dovesse risultare difficile per loro comprenderli a fondo (es. i buchi neri),</li>\r\n\t<li>Argomenti di cui si sta facendo ora ricerca, che permettano agli studenti di confrontarsi con l&rsquo;aspetto della reale ricerca scientifica legato alla risoluzione di un &ldquo;mistero&rdquo;.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pratiche scientifiche </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cosa vorreste che i vostri studenti fossero capaci di fare, su quali delle loro considerazioni vorreste produrre un effetto, &nbsp;e quali abilit&agrave; vorreste che sviluppassero? Questi aspetti sono importanti nell&rsquo;aiutare tutti gli studenti a &ldquo;valutare il mondo&rdquo; in modo scientifico, indipendentemente dal fatto che poi essi intraprendano una carriera scientifica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Il quadro di riferimento per elencare le &ldquo;buone pratiche&rdquo; scientifiche (estratto da U.S.&rsquo;s Next Generation Science Standards; NRC 2012) &egrave;:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Porre domande</li>\r\n\t<li>Sviluppare e utilizzare modelli</li>\r\n\t<li>Pianificare ed eseguire ricerche (indagini)</li>\r\n\t<li>Analizzare e interpretare i dati</li>\r\n\t<li>Utilizzare approcci matematici e computazionali</li>\r\n\t<li>Costruire spiegazioni valide</li>\r\n\t<li>Impegnarsi in una discussione partendo dall&rsquo;evidenza</li>\r\n\t<li>Comunicare le informazioni</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attitudini</strong><strong> scientifiche:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Le attivit&agrave; didattiche possono avere degli effetti su come gli studenti (e forse anche i loro insegnanti) si sentono nei confronti della scienza e della didattica stessa. Esempi a cui tendere: &ldquo;gli studenti si sentono&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ispirati a proseguire il loro percorso di apprendimento</li>\r\n\t<li>ispirati ad affrontare ulteriormente argomenti scientifici</li>\r\n\t<li>ispirati a diventare astronomi</li>\r\n\t<li>connessi alle scoperte astronomiche della loro cultura</li>\r\n\t<li>pi&ugrave; curiosi e interessati ad osservare il mondo attorno a loro</li>\r\n\t<li>stimolati a porsi domande sulle osservazioni scientifiche, e anche nelle loro vite</li>\r\n\t<li>stimolati a porsi domande per proprio conto</li>\r\n\t<li>connessi a (e anche rispettosi di)&nbsp; persone che hanno background molto diversi dal proprio (ponendosi nella giusta prospettiva data dalla piccolezza del nostro pianeta e dall&rsquo;immensit&agrave; del cosmo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>L&rsquo;apprendimento enquiry-based</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>L&rsquo;apprendimento enquiry-based &egrave; un metodo assai potente per imparare sia contenuti che ragionamenti scientifici. Parte essenziale di questo metodo &egrave; che gli studenti imparino la scienza con una modalit&agrave; che rispecchia le autentiche pratiche di ricerca scientifica, che sviluppino spiegazioni e che siano completamente responsabili durante tutto il loro cammino &nbsp;di apprendimento. Vi incoraggiamo a includere il metodo enquiry nelle vostre attivit&agrave;, per questo vi forniamo alcune informazioni aggiuntive metodo <a href=\"http://astroedu.iau.org/it/ebl/\"><u>enquiry-based learning</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alcuni trucchi affinch&eacute; le vostre risorse siano ampiamente utilizzate</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>gli studenti possono avere conoscenze pregresse (corrette o scorrette che siano) sugli argomenti relativi alla vostra attivit&agrave;. Includete quindi delle modalit&agrave; esplicite per conoscere quali sono le loro conoscenze pregresse, e anche delle modalit&agrave; che permettano loro stessi di identificare le eventuali misconcezioni.</li>\r\n\t<li>Prendete in considerazione l&rsquo;utilizzo di modalit&agrave; che permettano a studenti con livelli diversi di conoscenza di base di beneficiare comunque delle attivit&agrave;; per esempio prevedete la possibilit&agrave; di avere punti diversi di partenza e di arrivo nella ricerca; oppure anche modalit&agrave; diverse per dimostrare il proprio apprendimento (scrittura, parlato, disegno&hellip;).</li>\r\n\t<li>Evitate linguaggio colloquiale ma anche gergo tecnico.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ulteriori letture (in inglese)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Se avete qualche suggerimento su letture utili contattate la redazione!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Chinn C.

Esso costituisce una sorta di autoregolamentazione per i membri di una comunit&agrave; qualificata in un determinato ambito di studi. Il&nbsp;metodo &ldquo;peer-review&rdquo; previsto da astroEDU &egrave; quindi implementato per preservare gli standard di qualit&agrave; delle attivit&agrave; educative proposte, migliorarne la visibilit&agrave; e garantire l&rsquo;affidabilit&agrave; dei contenuti astronomici in esse riportati.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Colleghi come &ldquo;arbitri&rdquo;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tutte le&nbsp;attivit&agrave; di astroEDU saranno inviate a due revisori,&nbsp;che sono tra gli elementi&nbsp;pi&ugrave; importante di tutta la piattaforma astroEDU. I revisori previsti sono di due categorie: un revisore scientifico che si occuper&agrave; di controllare il contenuto astronomico delle attivit&agrave; proposte ed un altro che invece ne verificher&agrave; l&rsquo;aspetto educativo. Il primo &egrave; solitamente un ricercatore esperto del campo scientifico trattato nell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; in esame (per esempio,&nbsp;se l&#39;attivit&agrave; tratta del Sole, il revisore scientifico sar&agrave; un fisico solare). Il revisore responsabile dell&rsquo;aspetto educativo &egrave; invece un educatore esperto della particolare et&agrave; scolare degli studenti a cui l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; si rivolge (per esempio, se l&#39;attivit&agrave; &egrave; pensata per i bambini della scuola elementare allora il revisore per l&rsquo;aspetto educativo sar&agrave; un insegnante di scuola primaria o qualcuno con altrettanta esperienza di questo particolare grado di studi).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Le griglie di valutazione</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Abbiamo creato due diverse griglie di valutazione.&nbsp;Una per gli specialisti di settore (<a href=\"http://astroedu.iau.org/media/files/PeerReview-ContentSpecialist.pdf\" target=\"blank\">content specialists</a>) e una per gli esperti in didattica&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://astroedu.iau.org/media/files/PeerReview-Educator.pdf\" target=\"blank\">educators</a>)&nbsp;per esaminare la qualit&agrave; delle attivit&agrave; in modo standardizzatoma ma non troppo vincolante. I revisori sono invitati di a una molteplicit&agrave; di considerazioni che li aiutano a mettere nero su bianco commenti e suggerimenti.&nbsp;Gli autori delle attivit&agrave; sono incoraggiati a prendere visione di questa griglia di valutazione gi&agrave; durante la fase di progettazione iniziale delle attivit&agrave;, cos&igrave; da essere poi parzialmente guidati nel processo della loro creazione.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>La relazione del revisore</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>La redazione prende contatto con i revisori via email. Quando un revisore &egrave; contattato per controllare una determinata attivit&agrave;, &egrave; tenuto a rispondere al redattore il pi&ugrave; presto possibile, precisando se accetter&agrave; il ruolo di revisore assegnatogli. In caso di risposta negativa, &egrave; molto gradito qualche suggerimento di uno o pi&ugrave; revisori in alternativa.&nbsp;Le relazioni dovrebbero essere scritte in modo da aiutare ad affrontare tutte le questioni sollevate. Le modifiche suggerite dovranno essere chiaramente indicate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Il revisore &egrave; invitato a concludere la &nbsp;valutazione con una delle seguenti raccomandazioni:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; non deve essere accettata;</li>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;attivit&agrave;&nbsp;richiede significative modifiche prima della pubblicazione;</li>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;attivit&agrave;&nbsp;&egrave; raccomandata per la pubblicazione, con qualche lieve modifica;</li>\r\n\t<li>l&rsquo;attivit&agrave;&nbsp;&egrave; raccomandata per la pubblicazione senza revisioni.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Una volta che&nbsp;l&rsquo;attivit&agrave; &egrave; stata modificata dall&#39;autore, pu&ograve; essere inviata nuovamente al referente per la valutazione finale (se dopo la prima valutazione dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; erano state richieste solo lievi modifiche, il redattore pu&ograve;&nbsp;agire come referente finale senza interpellare nuovamente i revisori).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I revisori sono inoltre invitati a fornire raccomandazioni su come migliorare (se necessario) il registro linguistico e la comunicazione visiva dell&#39;attivit&agrave;. I revisori sono pregati di produrre le loro relazioni entro 3 settimane dalla data di accettazione del compito. Nel caso in cui essi abbiano bisogno di pi&ugrave; tempo, non siano in grado di produrre la loro relazione in un periodo di tempo ragionevole oppure non siano in grado di produrre una relazione, sono pregati di contattare la redazione al pi&ugrave; presto. La relazione del revisore deve essere inviata alla redazione di astroEDU e non all&#39;autore dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pubblicazione</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>La redazione&nbsp;decide di raccomandare la pubblicazione di un&rsquo;attivit&agrave; sulla base delle relazioni dei revisori e della sua coerenza con stile generale&nbsp;di astroEDU. La versione finale delle attivit&agrave; sar&agrave; quindi inviata al comitato editoriale per l&#39;approvazione definitiva. Una volta concordata la decisione finale il redattore la notificher&agrave; all&#39;autore solitamente non pi&ugrave; di 4 settimane dopo il primo invio dell&rsquo;attivit&agrave; (il numero di settimane potr&agrave; variare a seconda del livello di modifiche richieste dal revisore).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Una volta accettate, le attivit&agrave; saranno rese immediatamente disponibili su&nbsp;astroEDU&nbsp;(compreso il&nbsp;formato epub e la versione PDF) salvo che la redazione o l&rsquo;autore stesso non richiedano espressamente di ritardarne la pubblicazione.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>I feedback della comunit&agrave;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sulla base dei commenti e dei feedback lasciati sul sito di astroEDU, il redattore potr&agrave; agire da mediatore e modificare un&rsquo;attivit&agrave; integrando eventuali suggerimenti cos&igrave; ottenuti. Se le modifiche richieste fossero ingenti, il redattore potr&agrave; valutare la possibilit&agrave; di realizzare una nuova&nbsp;attivit&agrave; sulla base della vecchia, che verr&agrave; di nuovo sottoposta al processo di peer-review.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Volontari</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Se sei un astronomo professionista o un educatore, e vorresti diventare un revisore volontario delle attivit&agrave; di astroEDU, sei pregato di compilare con i tuoi dati l&rsquo;apposito&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unawe.typeform.com/to/UIBI5e\">modulo online.</a></p>\r\n"}}]
